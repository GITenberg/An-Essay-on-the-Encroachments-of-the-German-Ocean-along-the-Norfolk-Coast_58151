<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Many persons may consider it a remarkable circumstance, that
an individual, whose profession requires his leisure time to be
devoted to the acquirement of knowledge for the comfort of man in
his corporeal ailments, should find an opportunity to direct
considerable attention to a subject, so very different in
character, as the one now submitted to the reader. <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a>&nbsp; The suggestions, however, of a
near, respected, and venerable relative, aroused and stimulated
me to make the strictest investigation, and subsequently led to
the submitting a plan or design <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>for future benefit, not only to the
mariner, the merchant, the ship-owner, to those whose landed
property lies contiguous to the ocean, but what is of still
greater consequence, the preservation of human life; and although
an abler and a more experienced individual might have given a
better statement, or submitted a better design, yet it is hoped
sufficient will be found in this first and hasty attempt, to
excite the attention of the learned and the wealthy.</p>
<p>An acknowledgment of the truth, a grateful feeling for the
assistance derived for the most important particulars on this
interesting subject, induces me to introduce the name, with the
exertions of my venerable relative to the notice of my
readers.</p>
<p>The Rev. John Hewitt, B.A., Perpetual Curate of Walcot, in
this county, Vicar of Grantchester, and formerly a Fellow of
Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, after several years of often
repeated attention to the subject embraced in this Essay,
expended in the year A.D. 1802 upwards of one hundred pounds in
an attempt to fill up, at his own expence, the worst breach
existing between Waxham and Horsey, <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>and the design to carry it into effect
appeared so feasible, that to lessen the expence, the Hon.
Harbord Harbord, the first Lord Suffield, lent implements to aid
the undertaking.&nbsp; But unfortunately, prior to the task being
completed, a strong north-west wind, upon a spring tide, ensued,
and a quantity of water passed through the breach partially
repaired.</p>
<p>A cottager residing near the place, witnessed the circumstance
only just previous to the irruption of the water, and informed my
relative had he possessed a shovel, he could have prevented
it.</p>
<p>The circumstance attending this catastrophe caused in little
minds derision and contempt, from the failure of the
experiment.&nbsp; But a humble individual, whose ideas were more
enlarged, contended upwards of three hundred pounds worth of good
had been effected; and the spot on that part of the coast is
recognized to this day as Hewitt&rsquo;s Bank.</p>
<p>While some persons, therefore, considered it a direct failure,
my relative deemed it a partial one, and watched with
undiminished ardour the effect produced by the stranding of the
Hunter <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>cutter, A.D. 1807; the particulars of which are fully
entered into in the following pages.</p>
<p>A knowledge of the tides and currents has been principally
acquired from the perusal of several works of the most renowned
philosophers, whose erudition have stamped them with truth stable
and incontrovertible.&nbsp; I have, therefore, adopted their
language rather than my own, fearful I should mar their intent,
and my regard for such comprehensive writings induces me to add
the truism transmitted to us by an ancient Latin
author&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Unius &aelig;tatis sunt qu&aelig; fortiter fiunt,
qu&aelig;<br />
Vero pro utilitate scribuntur &aelig;terna.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Vegetius</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should the design be put in execution, and found efficacious,
it will be applicable to other coasts, by taking every particular
respecting them into consideration, and great will be the reward
on the ambition attained of having endeavoured to benefit the
community at large.</p>

<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">INTRODUCTION.&mdash;THE
FORMATION OF THE TIDES CONSIDERED, THEIR VARIATION, AND
EFFECTS.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>For, lo! the sea that fleets about the land,<br />
And like a girdle clips her solid waste,<br />
Music and measure both doth understand:<br />
For his great crystal eye is always cast<br />
Up to the moon, and on her fixed fast:<br />
And as she danceth in her pallid sphere,<br />
So danceth he about the centre here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above lines, so beautifully expressed by one of our
earlier poets, introduces a subject generally understood, but the
important object connected with our present inquiry cannot be
maintained without a thorough knowledge of cause and
effect.&nbsp; A minute acquaintance, therefore, with the
formation of the tides and currents, their variation and effects,
transmitted to us by the observations, experiments, and
discoveries of the earlier, and confirmed by the researches of
the modern philosophers, will not be deemed altogether
superfluous, as they will <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>tend to remove any obstacle that
might otherwise present itself on the consideration of so
difficult a subject.</p>
<p>By the term tide is meant that regular motion of the sea,
according to which it ebbs and flows twice in the twenty-four
hours.</p>
<p>After some wild conjectures of the earliest philosophers,
observes Goldsmith, it became well known in the time of Pliny
that the tides were entirely under the influence in a small
degree of the sun, but in a much greater of the moon.&nbsp; It
was found that there was a flux and reflux of the sea in the
space of twelve hours and fifty minutes, which is exactly the
time of a lunar day.&nbsp; It was observed that whenever the moon
was in the meridian, or in other words, as nearly as possible
over any part of the sea, that the sea flowed to that part, and
made a tide there; on the contrary, it was found that when the
moon left the meridian, the sea began to flow back again from
whence it came, and there might be said to ebb.&nbsp; Thus far
the waters of the sea seemed very regularly to attend the motions
of the moon.&nbsp; But as it appeared, likewise, that when the
moon was in the opposite meridian, as far off on the other side
of the globe, that there was a tide on this side also, so that
the moon produced two tides, one by her greatest approach to us,
and another by her greatest distance from us; in other words, the
moon, in once going round the earth, produced two tides, always
at the same time; one, on the part of the globe directly under
her; and the other, on the part of the globe directly
opposite.</p>
<p>Kepler was the first who conjectured that attraction was the
principal cause; asserting, that the sphere of the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>moon&rsquo;s
operation extended to the earth, and drew up its waters.&nbsp;
But what Kepler only hinted, has been completely developed and
demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>After his great discovery of the law of gravitation, he found
it an easy matter to account for the whole phenomena of the
tides.&nbsp; The moon, like all the rest of the planets, has been
found to attract and to be attracted by the earth.&nbsp; This
attraction prevails throughout our whole planetary system; the
more matter there is contained in any body, the more it attracts,
and its influence decreases in proportion as the distance, when
squared, increases.&nbsp; This being premised, let us see what
must ensue upon supposing the moon in the meridian of any tract
of the sea.&nbsp; The surface of the water immediately under the
moon, is nearer the moon than any part of the globe is, and,
therefore, must be more subject to its attraction than the waters
anywhere else.&nbsp; The waters will there be attracted by the
moon, and rise in a heap, whose eminence will be the highest
where the attraction is greatest.&nbsp; In order to form this
eminence, it is obvious that its surface, as well as the depths,
will be agitated, and that wherever the water runs from one part,
succeeding waters must run to fill up the space it has
left.&nbsp; Thus the waters of the sea, running from all parts to
attend the motion of the moon, produce the flowing of the tide;
and it is high tide at that part wherever the moon comes over it,
or to its meridian. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>But when the moon travels onward, and ceases to point over the
place where the waters were just risen, the cause of their rising
ceasing to operate, they will flow <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>back by their natural gravity into
the lower parts from whence they had travelled; and this retiring
of the waters will form the ebbing of the sea. <a
name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a></p>
<p>Thus the first part of the demonstration is obvious, since in
general it requires no great sagacity to conceive that the waters
nearest the moon are most attracted or raised highest by the
moon.&nbsp; But the other part of the demonstration, namely, how
there come to be high tides at the same time on the other side of
the globe is not so easy to conceive.&nbsp; To comprehend this,
it must be observed, that the part of the earth and its waters
farthest from the moon, are the parts of all others that are
least attracted by the moon; it must also be observed, that all
the waters, when the moon is on the opposite side of the earth,
must be attracted in the same direction that the earth itself
attracts them; that is apparently quite through the body of the
earth, towards the moon itself.&nbsp; This, therefore, being
conceived, it is plain that those waters which are farthest from
the moon will have less weight than those of any other part on
the same side of the globe, because the moon&rsquo;s attraction,
which conspires with the earth&rsquo;s attraction, is there
least.&nbsp; Now, therefore, the waters farthest from the moon
having less weight, and being lightest, will be pressed on all
sides by those that having more attraction are heavier, and the
heavier waters flowing in, will make them swell and rise in an
eminence directly opposite to that on the other side of the
globe, caused by the more immediate influence of the moon. <a
name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a></p>
<p>In this manner the moon, in one diurnal revolution, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>produces two
tides; one raised immediately under the sphere of its influence,
and the other directly opposite to it.&nbsp; As the moon travels,
this vast body of waters rears upward, as if to watch its
motions, and pursues the same constant rotation.&nbsp; However,
in this great work of raising the tides, the sun has no small
share, it produces its own tide constantly every day, just as the
moon does, but in a much less degree, because the sun is at an
immensely greater distance.&nbsp; Thus there are solar tides and
lunar tides&mdash;when the forces of these two great luminaries
concur, which they always do when they are either in the same or
in the opposite parts of the heavens, they jointly produce a much
greater tide, than when they are so situated in the heavens as
each to make peculiar tides of their own; in the former, the
attraction of the sun conspires with the attraction of the moon,
by which means the high spring tides are formed; in the latter,
the action of the sun is opposed to that of the moon,
consequently the effect must be to depress the waters where the
moon&rsquo;s action has a tendency to raise them, and hence the
production of the lower neap tides. <a name="citation13a"></a><a
href="#footnote13a" class="citation">[13a]</a></p>
<p>The spring tides <a name="citation13b"></a><a
href="#footnote13b" class="citation">[13b]</a> do not take place
on the very day of the new and full moon, nor the neap tides on
the very day of the quadratures, but a day or two after; the
effect is neither greatest nor least when the immediate influence
of the cause is greatest or least: as the greatest heat, for
example, is not on the solstitial day, when the immediate action
of the sun is greatest, but some time after it.&mdash;And
although the action of the sun and moon were to <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>cease, yet
the ocean would continue to ebb and flow for some time, as its
waves continue in violent motion for some time after a storm. <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton has shown that the tides increase as the cube
of the distances decrease, so that the moon, at half her present
distance, would produce a tide eight times greater.&nbsp; Now the
moon describes an ellipse about the earth, and of course must be
once in every revolution nearer the earth than in any other part
of her orbit; consequently she must produce a much higher tide
when in this point of her orbit than in the opposite point. <a
name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a></p>
<p>This is the reason that two great spring tides never take
place immediately after each other; for if the moon be at her
least distance at the time of new moon, she must be at her
greatest distance at the time of full moon, having performed half
a revolution in the intervening time; and, therefore, the spring
tide at the full will be much less than at the preceding
change.&nbsp; For the same reason, if a great spring tide happens
at the time of full moon, the tide at the following change will
be less. <a name="citation14c"></a><a href="#footnote14c"
class="citation">[14c]</a></p>
<p>The spring tides are highest and the neap tides lowest about
the beginning of the year; for the earth being nearest the sun
about the first of January, must be more strongly attracted by
that body than at any other time of the year: hence the spring
tides which happen about that time, will be greater than at any
other time, and should the moon be new or full in that part of
her orbit, which is nearest to the earth at the same time, the
tides will be considerably higher than at any other time of the
year.</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>The
tide which happens at any time while the moon is above the
horizon, is called the superior tide, and when below the horizon,
the inferior.&nbsp; When the moon is in the equinoctial, the
superior and inferior tides are of the same height, but when the
moon declines towards the elevated pole, the superior tide is
higher than the inferior.&nbsp; If the latitude of the place and
the declination of the moon are of contrary names, the inferior
tides will be the highest.&nbsp; But the highest tide at any
particular place is when the moon&rsquo;s declination is equal to
the latitude of the place, and of the same name, and the height
of the tide diminishes as the differences between the latitude
and declination increases, therefore the nearer any place is to
that parallel whose latitude is equal to the moon&rsquo;s
declination and of the same name, the higher will be the tide at
that place.&nbsp; In comparing the height of tides at different
places, it is supposed that the sun and moon are at the same
distances from the earth, and in the same position with respect
to the meridian of these places. <a name="citation15a"></a><a
href="#footnote15a" class="citation">[15a]</a></p>
<p>The above observations relative to the regularity of the tides
could only result by supposing the earth to be covered with the
waters of the ocean to a great depth, but as this is not the
case, it is only at places situated on the shores of large oceans
where such tides exist. <a name="citation15b"></a><a
href="#footnote15b" class="citation">[15b]</a></p>
<p>From local circumstances the tides are subject to great
irregularities, such as meeting with islands, headlands, passing
through straits, &amp;c.&nbsp; In order that they may have their
full motion, the ocean in which they are produced ought to extend
90&deg; from east to west, because that is the distance between
the greatest elevation and the greatest depression produced in
the waters by the moon.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Hence
it is that the tides in the Pacific Ocean exceed those of the
Atlantic, and that they are less in that part of the Atlantic
which is within the torrid zone between Africa and America, than
on the temperate zones on either side of it where the ocean is
much broader. <a name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a></p>
<p>Tides are not perceptible in lakes and most inland seas, and
deep and extensive as is the Mediterranean, are scarcely sensible
to ordinary observation, their effects being quite subordinate to
the winds and currents.&nbsp; In some places, however, as in the
Straits of Messina, there is an ebb and flow to the amount of two
feet and upwards; at Naples and at the Euripus, of twelve and
thirteen inches, and Rennell informs us, at Venice, of five feet.
<a name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a></p>
<p>The ebb and flow of the ocean is very slight in islands remote
from any continent, as for example, at St. Helena, where it
seldom exceeds three feet.&nbsp; Tides are remarkably high on the
coasts of Malay, in the Straits of Sunda, on the open coast of
Patagonia, along the coasts of China and Japan, at Panama, in the
Gulph of Bengal, and at the mouth of the Indus, where the water
rises thirty feet in height.&nbsp; Tides are greatest in any
given line of coast, in narrow bays and estuaries; and are least
in the intervening tracts where the land is prominent. <a
name="citation16c"></a><a href="#footnote16c"
class="citation">[16c]</a></p>
<p>On the authority of the late Captain Hewett, R.N., at the
entrance of the estuary of the Thames, the rise of the spring
tides is eighteen feet; but when we follow our eastern coast from
thence northward; towards Lowestoft <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>and Yarmouth, we find a gradual
diminution, until at the place last mentioned the highest rise is
only seven or eight feet.&nbsp; From this point there begins
again to be an increase, so that at Cromer, where the coast again
retires towards the west, the rise is sixteen feet; and towards
the extremity of the gulph called &ldquo;the Wash,&rdquo; as at
Lynn and in Boston Deeps, it is from twenty-two to twenty-four,
and in some extraordinary cases, twenty-six feet.&nbsp; From
thence again there is a decrease towards the north; the elevation
at the Spurn Point being from nineteen to twenty feet, and at
Flamborough Head, on the Yorkshire coast, from fourteen to
sixteen feet.</p>
<p>It is also recorded, on the authority of Captain Beaufort,
R.N., that at Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, at the mouth of
the Bristol Channel, the tides rise thirty-six feet, and at
King-road, near Bristol, forty-two feet.&nbsp; At Chepstow, on
the Wye, a small river which opens into the estuary of the
Severn, they reach fifty feet, sometimes sixty-nine, and even
seventy-two feet. <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>The tides at Tonquin are the most remarkable in the
world.&nbsp; In this part there is but one tide and one ebb every
twenty-four hours; whereas in other places there are two.&nbsp;
Besides twice in each month there is no tide at all, when the
moon is near the equinoctial, the water being for some time quite
stagnant.&nbsp; These, with other peculiar appearances attending
the same phenomena, were considered by many as inscrutable; but
Sir Isaac Newton adjudged them to arise from the concurrence of
two tides, one from the South Sea, and the other from the Indian
Ocean.&nbsp; Of each of these tides there <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>come
successively two every day; two at one time greater, and two at
another that are less.&nbsp; The time between the arrival of the
two greater is considered by him as high tide; the time between
the two lesser as ebb.&nbsp; In short, with this clue that great
mathematician solved every appearance, and so established his
theory as to silence every opposer.&nbsp; This fluctuation of the
sea from the tides, observes the same author, produces another
and more constant rotation of its waters from the east to the
west, in this respect following the course of the moon.</p>
<p>This may be considered as one great and general current of the
waters of the sea; and although it be not every where
distinguishable, it is nevertheless every where existent, except
when opposed by some particular current or eddy produced by
partial and local causes.&nbsp; This tendency of the sea towards
the west is plainly perceivable in all the great straits of the
ocean; as for instance, in those of Magellan, in South America,
where the tide running in from the east nearly twenty feet high,
and continues flowing six hours, whereas the ebb continues but
two hours, and the current is directed to the west.&nbsp; This
proves that the flux is not equal to the reflux, and that from
both results a motion of the sea westward, which is more powerful
during the time of the flux than the reflux.&nbsp; This motion
westward has been sensibly observed by navigators in their
passage back from India to Madagascar, and so on to Africa.&nbsp;
In the great Pacific, also, it is very perceivable; but the
places where it is most obvious are, as it was said, in those
straits which join one ocean to another.&nbsp; In the straits
between the Maldivia Islands, in the gulph of Mexico, between
Cuba and Jucatan.&nbsp; In the straits in the gulph of Paria, the
motion is so violent, that it has received the appellation <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of the
Dragon&rsquo;s Mouth.&nbsp; Northward, in the sea of Canada, in
Waigat&rsquo;s straits, in the straits of Java, and in short,
where the ocean on one part pours into the ocean on the
other.&nbsp; In this manner is the sea carried with an unceasing
circulation round the globe, and at the same time that its waters
are pushed backward and forward with the tide; they have thus a
progressive current to the west, which, though less observable,
is not the less real. <a name="citation19"></a><a

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE ORIGIN OF CURRENTS
THEIR VARIATION, EFFECTS, AND VELOCITY CONSIDERED.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> impulse communicated to the
waters of the ocean arises from its currents.&nbsp; These are
caused by the winds blowing for many months in one direction,
which produce on an expansive ocean movements of considerable
magnitude: this may be easily conceived when we observe the
effects produced on our own seas by the temporary action of the
same cause.</p>
<p>A strong south-west or north-west wind invariably raises the
tides to an unusual height along the east coast of England and
the Channel.&nbsp; Smeaton ascertained by experiment that in a
canal four miles in length, the water was kept up four inches
higher at one end than at the other, merely by the action of wind
along the canal; and Rennell informs us that a large piece of
water, ten miles broad, and generally only three feet deep, has
by a strong wind had its waters driven to one side, and sustained
so as to become six feet deep, while the windward side was laid
dry.&nbsp; He also observes, &ldquo;As water, when pent up so
that it cannot escape, acquires a higher level, so, in a place
where it can escape, the same operation produces a <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>current, and
this current will extend to a greater or less distance according
to the force by which it is produced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Currents flowing alternately in opposite directions are also
occasioned by the rise and fall of the tides.&nbsp; The effect of
this cause is, as before observed, in estuaries and channels
between islands.</p>
<p>Evaporation by solar heat is another cause of oceanic
currents, of which the great current setting through the Straits
of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean, is a remarkable
example.&nbsp; A stream of colder water always flows from the
Black Sea into the Mediterranean.&nbsp; It must happen in many
other parts of the world that large quantities of water, raised
from one tract of the ocean by solar heat, are carried to some
other, where the vapour is condensed, and falls in the shape of
rain, and this, in flowing back again to restore equilibrium,
will cause sensible currents.&nbsp; There is still another way in
which heat and cold must occasion great movements in the ocean; a
cause to which, perhaps, currents are principally due.&nbsp; It
is now ascertained that there is in sea water no point, as in
fresh water, at which an increase of cold causes the fluid to
begin again to expand.&nbsp; In the ocean, therefore, whenever
the temperature of the surface is lowered, condensation takes
place, and the superficial water having its specific gravity
increased, falls to the bottom, upon which lighter water rises
immediately, and occupies its place.&nbsp; When this circulation
of ascending and descending currents has gone on for a certain
time in high latitudes; the inferior parts of the sea are made to
consist of colder or heavier fluid than the corresponding depths
of the ocean between the tropics.&nbsp; If <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>there be a
free communication, if no chain of submarine mountains divide the
polar from the equatorial basins, a horizontal movement will
arise by the flowing of colder water from the poles to the
equator, and there will then be a reflux of warmer superficial
water from the equator to the poles.&nbsp; A well-known
experiment has been adduced to elucidate this mode of action in
explanation of the &ldquo;trade winds.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a long
trough, divided in the middle by a sluice or partition, have one
end filled with water, and the other with quick silver, both
fluids will remain quiet so long as they are divided, but when
the sluice is drawn up, the heavier fluid will rush along the
bottom of the trough, while the lighter, from being displaced,
will rise, and flowing in an opposite direction, spread itself at
the top.&nbsp; The expansion and contraction of sea water by heat
and cold, have in a similar manner, a tendency to set under
currents in motion from the poles to the equator, and to cause
counter currents at the surface, which are impelled contrary to
that of prevailing-trade winds.&nbsp; The geographical and other
circumstances being very complicated, we cannot expect to trace
separately the movements due to each cause, but must be prepared
for many anomalies, especially as the bed of the ocean must often
modify and interfere with the course of the inferior currents, as
much as the position and form of continents and islands alter the
direction of those on the surface.&nbsp; Thus, on sounding at
great depths in the Mediterranean, Captains Berard and
D&rsquo;Urville have found that the cold does not increase in a
high ratio, as in the tropical regions of the ocean, the
thermometer remaining fixed at about 55&deg; F. between the
depths of 1000 and 6000 feet; and Captain Smith has shown in his
survey, that the deepest part in the Straits of Gibraltar <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>is only 1320
feet, so that a submarine barrier exists there, which must
prevent the influx of any under current of the ocean cooled by
the polar ice.</p>
<p>The rotation of the earth on its axis is another cause which
can only come into play when the waters have been already set in
motion by some one or all of the forces above described, and when
the direction of the current so raised happens to be from south
to north, or from north to south, the principle on which this
operates has been long recognized in the case of trade winds;
thus, when a current flows from the Cape of Good Hope towards the
Gulph of Guinea, it consists of a mass of water, which, on
doubling the Cape, in latitude 35&deg;, has a rotatory velocity
of about 800 miles an hour; but when it reaches the line, it
arrives at a parallel where the surface of the earth is whirled
round at the rate of 1000 miles an hour, or about 200 miles
faster.&nbsp; If this great mass of water was transferred
suddenly from the higher to the lower latitude, the deficiency of
its rotatory motion, relatively to the land and water with which
it would come into juxta position, would be such as to cause an
apparent motion of the most rapid kind (of no less than 200 miles
an hour) from east to west. <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a></p>
<p>In the case of such a sudden transfer, the eastern coast of
America being carried round in an opposite direction, might
strike against a large body of water with tremendous violence,
and a considerable part of the continent might be
submerged.&nbsp; This disturbance does not occur, because the
water of the stream, as it advances gradually into new zones of
the sea, acquires <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>by friction an accelerated velocity.&nbsp; Yet as this
motion is not imparted instantaneously, the fluid is unable to
keep up with the full speed of the new surface over which it is
successively brought; and Herschel, in his Treatise on Astronomy,
observes, when speaking of the trade winds, it lags or hangs back
in a direction opposite to the earth&rsquo;s rotation, that is
from east to west; <a name="citation24a"></a><a
href="#footnote24a" class="citation">[24a]</a> and thus a current
which would have run simply towards the north but for the
rotation, may acquire a relative direction towards the west, or
become a south-easterly current. <a name="citation24b"></a><a
href="#footnote24b" class="citation">[24b]</a></p>
<p>The most extensive and best determined system of currents is
that which has its source in the Indian Ocean, under the
influence of the trade winds; and which, after doubling the Cape
of Good Hope, inclines to the northward, along the western coast
of Africa; then crosses the Atlantic near the Equator, and is
lost in the Caribbean Sea; yet seems to be again revived in the
current which issues from the Gulph of Mexico, by the Straits of
Bahama, and flows rapidly in a north-easterly direction, by the
bank of Newfoundland, towards the Azores.</p>
<p>Rennell informs us, that the Lagullas current, so called from
the cape and bank of that name, is formed by the junction of two
streams flowing from the Indian Ocean, the one from the channel
of Mozambique, down the south-east coast of Africa, the other
from the ocean at large.&mdash;The collective stream is from
ninety to one hundred miles in breadth, and runs at the rate of
from two and a half to more than four miles per hour.&nbsp; It is
at length turned westward by the Lagullas bank, which rises from
a sea of <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>great depth, to within one hundred fathoms of the
surface.&nbsp; It must therefore be inferred, says Rennell, that
the current here is more than one hundred fathoms deep, otherwise
the main body of it would pass across the bank, instead of being
deflected eastward, so as to flow round the Cape of Good
Hope.&nbsp; From this Cape it flows northward, along the western
coast of Africa, taking the name of the South Atlantic
current.&nbsp; It then enters the Bight or Bay of Benin, and is
turned westward, partly by the form of the coast there, and
partly, perhaps, by the Guinea current, which runs from the north
into the same great bay.&nbsp; From the centre of this bay
proceeds the Equatorial current, holding a westerly direction
towards the Atlantic, which it traverses from the coast of Guinea
to that of Brazil, flowing afterwards by the shores of Guiana to
the West Indies.&nbsp; The breadth of this current varies from
one hundred and sixty to four hundred and fifty geographical
miles, and its velocity is from twenty five to seventy nine miles
per day, the mean rate being about thirty miles.&nbsp; The length
of its whole course is about four thousand miles.&nbsp; As it
skirts the coast of Guiana, it is increased by the influx of the
waters of the Amazon and Orinoco, and by their junction acquires
accelerated velocity.&nbsp; After passing the island of Trinadad,
it expands, and is almost lost in the Caribbean Sea; but there
appears to be a general movement of that sea towards the Mexican
Gulph, which discharges the most powerful of all currents through
the Straits of Florida, where the waters run in the northern part
with a velocity of five miles an hour, having a breadth of from
thirty five to fifty miles. <a name="citation25"></a><a
href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a></p>
<p>The temperature of the Gulph of Mexico is 86&deg; in summer,
<a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>or 6&deg;
higher than that of the ocean in the same parallel (25&deg; N.
lat.) and a large proportion of this warmth is retained, even
where the stream reaches the 43&deg; N. lat.&nbsp; After issuing
from the Straits of Florida, the current runs in a northerly
direction to Cape Hatteras, in North Carolina, about 35&deg; N.
lat. where it is more than seventy miles broad, and still moves
at the same rate of seventy five miles per day.&nbsp; In about
40&deg; N. lat. it is turned more towards the Atlantic by the
extensive banks of Nantucket and St. George, which are from two
hundred to three hundred feet beneath the surface of the sea; a
clear proof that the current exceeds that depth.&nbsp; On
arriving near the Azores, the stream widens and overflows, as it
were forming a large expanse of warm water in the centre of the
north Atlantic, over a space of two or three hundred miles from
north to south, and having a temperature of from 8&deg; to
10&deg; Fahr. above the surrounding ocean.&nbsp; The whole area
covered by the gulph water is estimated by Rennell at two
thousand miles in length, and at a mean, three hundred and fifty
miles in breadth, an area more extensive than that of the
Mediterranean.&nbsp; The warm water has been sometimes known to
reach the Bay of Biscay, still retaining five degrees of
temperature above that of the adjoining ocean; and a branch of
the gulf current drifts fruits, plants, and wood, the produce of
America and the West Indies, to the shores of Ireland and the
Hebrides. <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p>From the above statements, observes Mr. Lyell, we may
understand why Rennell has characterised some of the principal
currents as oceanic rivers, which he describes as being from
fifty to two hundred and fifty miles in breadth, and having a
rapidity exceeding that of the largest navigable <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>rivers of the
continent, and so deep as to be sometimes obstructed and
occasionally turned aside by banks, the tops of which do not rise
within forty, fifty, or even one hundred fathoms of the surface
of the sea.</p>
<p>The ordinary velocity of the principal currents of the ocean
is from one to three miles per hour; but when the boundary lands
converge, large bodies of water are driven gradually into a
narrow space, and then, wanting lateral room, are compelled to
raise their level.&nbsp; Whenever this occurs, their velocity is
much increased.&nbsp; The current which runs through the Race of
Alderney, between the island of that name and the main land, has
a velocity of about eight English miles an hour.&nbsp; The late
Captain Hewett found that in the Pentland Firth the stream, in
ordinary spring tides, runs ten miles and a half an hour, and
about thirteen miles during violent storms.&nbsp; The greatest
velocity of the tidal current through the &ldquo;Shoots or New
Passage,&rdquo; in the Bristol Channel, is fourteen miles an
hour; and Captain King observed, in his recent survey of the
Straits of Magellan, that the tide ran at the same rate through
the &ldquo;First Narrows,&rdquo; and about eight geographical
miles an hour in other parts of those straits.</p>
<p>The course of currents on the British shores is ascertained to
be as winding as that of ordinary rivers.&nbsp; Sometimes they
run between banks of sand, which consist of matter thrown down at
certain points where the velocity of the stream has been
retarded, but it very frequently occurs, that as in a river one
bank is made of low alluvial gravel, while the other is composed
of some hardy and lofty rocks constantly undermined, so the
current in <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>its bends strikes here and there upon a coast which then
forms one bank, whilst a shoal under water forms the other.&nbsp;
If the coast be formed of solid materials, it yields slowly; so
also if it be of great height, for in that case a large quantity
of matter must be removed before the sea can penetrate to any
distance.</p>
<p>Currents depend, like tides, on no temporary or accidental
circumstances, but on the laws which preside over the motions of
the heavenly bodies.&nbsp; The height to which tides rise, and
the violence and velocity of the currents, depend in a great
measure on the actual configuration of the land, the contour of a
long line of continental or insular coast, the depth and breadth
of channels, the peculiar form at the bottom of the seas&mdash;in
a word, on a combination of circumstances which are made to vary
continually by many igneous and aqueous causes, and among the
rest, by the tides and currents themselves.&nbsp; Although these
agents of decay and reproduction are local in reference to
periods of short duration, such as those which history embraces,
they are nevertheless universal, if we extend our views to a
sufficient lapse of ages. <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a></p>
<p>Currents, observes Goldsmith, act their part in a smaller
sphere, being generally greatest where the motions of the sea are
least, namely, nearest the shores, and with the tides, produce
the most rapid changes; their motion agitates the substances of
which their bed is composed, and at the bottom of the sea, the
greatest wonders are performed, for while the sea has been known
to recede from some lands, so it has been found to encroach upon
others, <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>and probably these depredations on one part of the shore
may account for the dereliction of another, for the current which
rested upon some certain bank, having got an egress in some other
place, it no longer presses upon its former bed, but pours all
its stream into the new entrance, so that every inundation of the
sea may be attended with some correspondent dereliction of
another shore, where the sea meets no obstacles, it spreads with
a gentle intumescence, till all the power is destroyed by wanting
depth to aid the motion, but when the progress is checked in the
midst by the prominence of rocks or the abrupt elevation of land,
it dashes with all its force its depth against the obstacle, and
forms, by its repeated violence, that abruptness of the shore
which confines its impetuosity.&nbsp; Where the sea is extremely
deep, and very much vexed with tempests, it is no small obstacle
that can confine its rage; and for this reason, we see the
boldest shores projected against the deepest waters, all less
impediments having long before been surmounted and washed
away.&nbsp; In places where the force of the sea is less violent,
or its tides less rapid, the shores are generally seen to descend
with a more gradual declivity.&nbsp; Upon these shores the sea
seldom beats with any great violence, as a large wave has not
depth sufficient to float it onwards, so that here only are to be
seen gentle surges making towards the land, and lessening as they
approach.&nbsp; As the sea, in the former description, is
generally seen to present prospects of tumult and uproar, here it
more usually exhibits a repose and tranquil beauty.&nbsp; Its
waters which, when surveyed from the precipice, afforded a muddy
greenish hue, arising from their depth and position to the eye,
<a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a> when regarded from a shelving shore,
were the colour of the sky, and seem <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>rising to meet it.&nbsp; The
deafening noise of the deep sea is here converted into gentle
murmurs; instead of the waters dashing against the face of the
rock, it advances and recedes, still going forward but with just
force enough to push its weeds and shells, by insensible
approaches, to the shore.</p>

TIDES&mdash;DISASTROUS EFFECTS IN COMBINATION WITH GALES OF WIND
FROM THE NORTH-WEST ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COAST UNDER
CONSIDERATION&mdash;EXAMPLES.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> workings of Nature itself,
under the control of an Allwise and Omnipotent Being, ever
exhibit a restorative as well as a destructive power.&nbsp; Its
laws and constitution being no where directly revealed to us, are
only to be inferred from the inspection of particular facts,
obtained from observation and experiment, the only trust-worthy
guides to the knowledge of Nature.&nbsp; Let us
inquire&mdash;first, the cause of the German Ocean gaining upon
the Norfolk coast? secondly, whether every portion is the subject
of such visitation, attended with similar results? and thirdly,
whether art can arrest its progress?</p>
<p>The German Ocean, from its being intersected with numerous
shoals of sand, some of immense length and breadth, presents a
greater variation in the tides and currents than probably any
other ocean in the world; and from its exposure to variable and
violent winds, renders the navigation extremely dangerous.&nbsp;
Its extent in area is about two millions of square miles, and is
confined within its narrowest limits between England and Holland,
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>and there
in consequence the tides rise highest.&nbsp; It opens into the
Atlantic on the north, and communicates with the English Channel
by the Straits of Dover, and with the Baltic Sea by the Scaggerac
and Cattegat.&nbsp; It may be considered as divided into two
parts by the Dogger Bank, which traverses it in almost all its
width, and a strong tide runs from north to south, <a
name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a> which is much increased by north and
north-west winds.</p>
<p>From the earliest records to the present time, that portion of
the coast extending from Cromer to Winterton-ness has been most
subjected to the ravages of the ocean; lands have been swept
away, buildings of considerable value have been swallowed up, and
notwithstanding every effort hitherto made, the sea continues to
advance in the interior as little satiated as before.&nbsp; The
line of coast is extremely favourable to its rapacity,
presenting, as it does, the appearance of a cape, and the
different strata composing the cliffs are generally of too
yielding a nature to resist its influence, even under ordinary
circumstances.&mdash;The Hasborough Sands, extending from
Winterton, to or a little beyond Bacton, must, from their
dimensions and abrupt elevation, be a source of considerable
mischief, confining a vast body of water within a narrow limit,
which, when increased and disturbed by gales of wind from the
north-west, upon a spring tide, urges the waves against the
cliffs with a greater or less velocity, and with a force not only
sufficient to sweep away large quantities of the earth, which,
from the perpendicularity of the cliffs, is deposited at their
base, but actually to undermine them to a considerable
extent.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Numerous instances can be adduced where the current has
taken away twenty-one yards of land from the interior in three
tides; and it was computed when the present Inn was built in
Lower Sherringham, near Cromer, in 1805, that it would require
seventy years for the sea to reach the spot, the mean loss of
land being calculated, from previous observations, to be somewhat
less than one yard annually; the distance between the house and
the sea was fifty yards, but no allowance was made for the slope
of the ground being from the sea, in consequence of which the
waste was naturally accelerated every year as the cliff grew
lower, there being at each succeeding period less matter to
remove when portions of equal area fell down.&nbsp; Between the
years 1824 and 1829, no less than seventeen yards were swept
away, and the distance between the house and the edge of the
cliff at this time is only from eight to ten yards.</p>
<p>The whole site of ancient Cromer <a name="citation33a"></a><a
href="#footnote33a" class="citation">[33a]</a> now forms part of
the German Ocean, the inhabitants having gradually retreated
inland to the present situation, from whence the sea still
threatens to dislodge them.&nbsp; The locality of this portion of
the coast, the scarcity of sea beach material in the offing, the
bed of the ocean of a rocky character, and the beach presenting
nearly a level approaching a dead flat render it peculiarly
liable to its invasion.</p>
<p>At Trimingham <a name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a> upwards of fifty acres of land have
been removed during the last sixty years, and on one occasion
four acres and a half were taken away in one tide.</p>
<p>The property belonging to Mr. Wheatley, at <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Mundesley, <a
name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a> has become considerably reduced in
extent and value, and has only been preserved to the present time
by substantial walls erected next the sea, and numerous piles of
wood driven into the sand beyond them: but what renders it most
disheartening is, the sea has excavated the cliff at their
extremity; and the probability is, should a heavy lasting gale of
wind ensue from the north-west upon a spring tide, they, with
perhaps the greater portion of the property, will be swept away
by the water intruding behind and between them.&nbsp; Land
attached to the estate of S. Bignold, Esq., adjoining Walcot <a
name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b"
class="citation">[34b]</a> Gap, previous to 1839, was rapidly
taken away.</p>
<p>At Hasborough, <a name="citation34c"></a><a
href="#footnote34c" class="citation">[34c]</a> the sea has
encroached upwards of one hundred and seventy yards during the
last sixty years, and it is calculated the church will be
engulphed in the Ocean before the middle of the ensuing
century.</p>
<p>The ancient villages of Shipden, <a name="citation34d"></a><a
href="#footnote34d" class="citation">[34d]</a> Whimpwell, <a
name="citation34e"></a><a href="#footnote34e"
class="citation">[34e]</a> and Keswick <a

class="citation">[34f]</a> have entirely disappeared, and nearly
the whole of Eccles. <a name="citation34g"></a><a
href="#footnote34g" class="citation">[34g]</a>&nbsp; A monument,
however, still remains in the ruined tower of the old church,
which is half buried in the dunes of sand.&nbsp; These have been
fast encroached upon since 1839, laying bare the foundations of
dwellings, the chancel end of the church, with a portion of a
wall supposed to have surrounded the church-yard.&nbsp; The upper
part of the buildings had evidently been removed previous to the
foundations having been buried under the sand.</p>
<p>Hills of blown sand, between Eccles and Winterton, <a
name="citation34h"></a><a href="#footnote34h"
class="citation">[34h]</a> extending to Yarmouth, have barred up
and excluded the tide for many centuries from the mouths of
several small <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>estuaries; but there are records of nine breaches, from
twenty to one hundred and twenty yards wide, having been made
through these, by which immense damage was done to the low
grounds in the interior.&nbsp; One of the most remarkable
occurred in the year 1792, on which occasion a body of water
passed through between Horsey <a name="citation35a"></a><a
href="#footnote35a" class="citation">[35a]</a> and Waxham, <a
name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b"
class="citation">[35b]</a> extending beyond Hickling, a village
situated three miles inland, which, uniting with the fresh water
contained in a large lake, termed the Hickling broad, destroyed
all the fish.&nbsp; The injury the land sustained in the
immediate neighbourhood was very considerable; upon one farm a
loss of upwards of three hundred pounds was experienced, and
years passed by before the land recovered its former
fertility.&nbsp; The effluvia arising from the subsidence or
sinking of the water filled the air with malaria of the worst
description.&nbsp; Intermittent and typhoid fevers of a most
formidable character prevailed, so that many an individual was
brought to a premature grave through this catastrophe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> now brought together ample
proofs of the destructive operations of the waves, tides, and
currents upon our eastern coast, let us observe examples of their
restorative power, in many instances aided and assisted by the
hand of man.</p>
<p>The German Ocean is deepest on the Norwegian side, where the
soundings give one hundred and ninety fathoms; but the mean depth
of the whole basin may be stated at no more than thirty-one
fathoms. <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a>&nbsp; The bed of this sea is traversed
by several enormous banks: one of which, occupying a central
position, trends from the Frith of Forth in a north-easterly
direction, to a distance of one hundred and ten miles; others run
from Denmark and Jutland, upwards of one hundred and five miles
to the <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>north-west; while the greatest of all, the Dogger Bank,
extends for upwards of three hundred and fifty-four miles from
north to south. <a name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a>&nbsp; The whole superficies of these
enormous shoals is equal to about one-fifth of the whole area of
the German Ocean, or to about one-third of the whole extent of
England and Scotland. <a name="citation37b"></a><a
href="#footnote37b" class="citation">[37b]</a>&nbsp; The average
height of the banks measures, according to Mr. Stevenson, about
seventy-eight feet; the upper portion consisting of fine and
course silicious sand, mixed with comminuted corals and shell. <a
name="citation37c"></a><a href="#footnote37c"
class="citation">[37c]</a>&nbsp; Some long narrow ravines are
found to intersect the banks.&nbsp; One of these varies from
seventeen to forty-four fathoms in depth and has very precipitous
sides: in one part, called the &ldquo;Inner Silver Pits,&rdquo;
it is fifty-five fathoms deep.&nbsp; The shallowest parts of the
Dogger Bank were found to be forty-two feet under water, except
in one place, where the wreck of a ship had caused a shoal.</p>
<p>These sands receive fresh increase every day; so that in time
the place bids fair to become habitable earth.</p>
<p>The kingdom of Holland seems to be a conquest upon the sea,
and in a manner rescued from its bosom.&nbsp; The surface of the
earth, in this country, is below the level of the bed of the
ocean; and I remember, observes Buffon, upon approaching the
coast, to have looked down upon it from the sea, as into a
valley: however, it is every day <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>rising higher by the depositions made
upon it by the sea, the Rhine and the Meuse, and those parts
which formerly admitted large men of war, are now known to be too
shallow to receive ships of very moderate burden.</p>
<p>The formation of new lands by the sea&rsquo;s continually
bringing its sediment to one place, and by the accumulation of
its sands in another, is easily conceived.&nbsp; We have had many
instances of this in England.&nbsp; The island of Oxney, which is
adjacent to Romney-marsh, was produced in this manner.&nbsp; This
had for a long time been a low level, continually in danger of
being overflown by the river Rother; but the sea, by its
depositions, has gradually raised the bottom of the river, while
it has hollowed its mouth; so that the one is sufficiently
secured from inundations, and the other is deep enough to admit
ships of considerable burthen.</p>
<p>On many parts of the coasts of France, England, Holland,
Germany, and Prussia, the sea has been sensibly known to retire.
<a name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a"
class="citation">[38a]</a></p>
<p>Instances of new lands having been produced from the sea are
brought about by two different ways; first, by the waters raising
banks of sand or mud where the sediment is deposited; and,
secondly, by their relinquishing the shore entirely, and leaving
it unoccupied to the industry of man. <a
name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a></p>
<p>The quantity of sand, stones, &amp;c., moved here and there by
the tidal current is very considerable, and no given <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>line of the
coast can afford a better example than the one under
consideration.</p>
<p>The Hasborough Sands probably increase in breadth if not in
length, since every year they receive fresh accessions from
vessels buried in their vortex, which afford a nucleus for
retaining the sand lodging against them.</p>
<p>The Cockle Sands, off Caistor, <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a> have increased since
1836 one mile and a half in extent to the northward.</p>
<p>The deposition of sands, stones, shingle, &amp;c., upon our
coast, especially during the summer months, when easterly,
southerly, and westerly winds prevail, would strike the beholder
unaccustomed to witness the contrary effects, as an apparent
impossibility, that the water could remove such an immense
quantity of material especially in the short time that it does
when a north-west gale prevails.</p>
<p>Shoals of sand of various length, breadth, and depth, appear
and disappear, form and re-form, in the offing.&mdash;In
north-westerly gales only are they solid, stable, and compact,
and increase in breadth, while the materials on the beach are
swept away.&nbsp; They extend in a direction parallel with the
shore, and present an inclined plane, on each side of their base
a corresponding shallow exists, and the tidal current will not
allow materials to rest on their surface sufficiently to increase
their elevation, and render them more efficient.&nbsp; As it is,
however, they are natural breakwaters, but from their
irregularity in extent, dimensions, and situation, they afford
only a partial protection to the coast.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>The
incursions of the sea at Aldborough, in Suffolk, were formerly
very destructive; and this borough is known to have been once
situated a quarter of a mile east of the present shore.&nbsp; The
inhabitants continued to build further inland, till they arrived
at the extremity of their property, and then the town decayed
greatly; but two sandbanks thrown up at a short distance, now
afford a temporary safeguard to the coast.&nbsp; Between these
banks and the present shore, where the current now flows, the sea
is twenty-four feet deep on the spot where the town formerly
stood.</p>
<p>Immediately off Yarmouth, <a name="citation40a"></a><a
href="#footnote40a" class="citation">[40a]</a> and parallel to
the shore, is a range of sand-banks, the shape of which varies
slowly from year to year, and often suddenly after great
storms.&nbsp; The late Captain Hewett, R.N., found in these
banks, in 1836, a broad channel sixty-five feet deep, where there
was only a depth of four feet during a prior survey in
1822.&nbsp; The sea had excavated to the depth of sixty feet in
the course of fourteen years, or perhaps a shorter period. <a
name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a></p>
<p>Wherever a shoal of sand exists in the offing, at a distance
beyond where the ebbing of the tide recedes to its greatest
extent, denominated low water mark, there the innermost shallow
will probably be: another shoal immediately forms, the base
commencing at low water mark, and a gradual rise takes place
towards the cliffs, terminating at or beyond the extent of the
flowing of the tide denominated high water mark.&nbsp; Here,
then, the shoal will be more efficient; the tidal wave and
current will be checked and broken against the ascending
bank.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>But
should a shoal of sand form whose superior surface terminates at
low water mark, the innermost shallow <a name="citation41"></a><a
href="#footnote41" class="citation">[41]</a> will be observed
nearer to, and its course frequently terminate in, an angular
direction to the cliffs; and between the intermediate spaces of
the shoals existing in the offing, a current frequently sets in
towards the shore, which will aid the force of the tidal wave and
current, when called into excessive action, in its attack either
upon the cliff opposite, or a partial shoal nearest it.&nbsp;
Under these circumstances, the one will soon lose its inclined
surface, and the other will become undermined.</p>
<p>Where shoals of sand exist in the offing, there the beach is
widest, and where they do not exist, there the beach is
narrowest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears, from the observations
of Mr. Palmer and others, that if a pier or groin be erected
anywhere on our southern or south-eastern coast, to stop the
progress of the beach, a heap of shingle soon collects on the
western side of such artificial barriers, <a
name="citation42a"></a><a href="#footnote42a"
class="citation">[42a]</a> while on our eastern coast, sand,
stones, &amp;c., accumulate to the northward.</p>
<p>The plans hitherto pursued by public and private individuals
have been to place abrupt perpendicular bodies, not to the
southward of the property they have been most anxious to save,
but have erected them directly opposite.&nbsp; Thus Mr. Wheatley,
of Mundsley, <a name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b"
class="citation">[42b]</a> had the hulls of old vessels placed
upon the shore at the base of the cliffs adjoining <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>his property;
they were filled with large stones, secured with piles driven
into the beach on either side, fore and aft, also by a strong
chain cable, &amp;c.; but a few years since they were entirely
removed by the sea during a heavy gale of wind from the
north-west upon a spring tide.</p>
<p>The town of Cromer, <a name="citation43a"></a><a
href="#footnote43a" class="citation">[43a]</a> on the same
occasion, met with considerable loss.&nbsp; The jetty erected at
the north end of the town caused a large mound of sand to
accumulate to the eastward of it, presenting an inclined surface
towards the sea, and during the intervention of north-westerly
gales, indigenous grasses sprung up, and covered the surface
nearest the banks; this time, however, the jetty gave way, and
the greater portion of the mound of sand was removed; but still
there was sufficient left to convince the inhabitants, had the
jetty been erected at the west end of the town, their property
would have been saved.</p>
<p>In the erection of a groin at Trimingham, <a
name="citation43b"></a><a href="#footnote43b"
class="citation">[43b]</a> a few years since, large square piles,
about ten or twelve inches in diameter, were driven into the
beach, at a right angle, to the base of the tall cliffs, and
extended to or beyond low water mark; they were left projecting a
considerable height above the then surface of the beach, and
strong planks, fastened with iron bolts, were continuously
attached to the tops of the projecting piles.&nbsp; The shallow
existing must have been considerable in length, breadth, and
depth; for subsequently a heavy sea, produced from a northerly
gale, removed several of the piles entirely, and others were
forced from a perpendicular to a horizontal position.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>This
circumstance, however, is readily accounted for, the strata into
which the piles were inserted at a particular part, passed
through blue clay into blue sand of a loose texture, and the
piles were not driven to a depth necessary to reach or enter the
solid strata beneath; now if we take into consideration the
length and depth of the shallow, and breadth of surface presented
by pile and plank, subjected to the full sweep of the tidal
current from north to south, or rather at this point from east to
west, aided and assisted by an increased flow of water from the
Atlantic, we cannot be surprised at the result above
mentioned.&nbsp; It was found necessary to support those left
with additional piles placed horizontally on the west side.&nbsp;
The effect produced by this costly groin was an accumulation of
sea-beach materials to the northward, extending about thirty
yards from the base of the cliff towards the sea, reaching to the
top of the pile and plank; from thence an abrupt declination
ensued, and terminated at the part from whence the piles,
&amp;c., alluded to had been removed.</p>
<p>Immediately to the southward of this barrier scarcely any
accumulation of sea-beach materials had taken place, and the sea
was committing greater ravages upon the cliffs adjoining than
before. <a name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a></p>
<p>The plan of driving piles into the beach, for the purpose of
retaining it, and encouraging materials to lodge on its surface,
and consequently to break the force of the waves, has long been
adopted on different coasts in England; and where a continuation
of them has been practised, in certain localities, seem to have
been attended <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>with success; in others they have exhibited only a
partial protection, from their temporary duration, and
considerable inconvenience has been felt on coasts where shingle
predominates, from pebbles pouring over in great numbers during
heavy gales.</p>
<p>The immense quantity of sand displayed on this portion of the
coast affords not only a different feature, but more gratifying
results may be anticipated.&nbsp; In Yarmouth, the sea has not
advanced upon the sands in the slightest degree since the reign
of Elizabeth, and where the town is built became firm and
habitable ground about the year 1008, from which time a line of
dunes has gradually increased in height and breadth, stretching
across the whole entrance of the ancient estuary, and obstructing
the ingress of the tides so completely, that they are only
admitted by a narrow passage, which the river keeps open, and
which has gradually shifted several miles to the south. <a
name="citation45a"></a><a href="#footnote45a"
class="citation">[45a]</a></p>
<p>By the exclusion of the sea, thousands of acres in the
interior have become cultivated lands; and exclusive of small
pools, upwards of sixty fresh water lakes have been formed,
varying in depth from fifteen to thirty feet, and in extent from
one to twelve hundred acres. <a name="citation45b"></a><a
href="#footnote45b" class="citation">[45b]</a></p>
<p>The benefit derived from the erection of piers at the
Haven&rsquo;s mouth, has, in conjunction with the jetty, afforded
great protection to the town of Yarmouth.&nbsp; The tidal wave
and current has been checked, the shore has been elevated,
retained, and rendered wider to the northward, as far as
Winterton; <a name="citation45c"></a><a href="#footnote45c"
class="citation">[45c]</a> a shoal of sand has formed, and
extends a considerable distance into the sea, <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>at right
angles to the shore, beyond the termination of the north pier, so
that it has been found necessary to place a buoy at its
extremity, as a guide for the mariner to steer due east from the
Haven&rsquo;s Mouth to Yarmouth Roads.&nbsp; The jetty, extending
into the sea upwards of four hundred and fifty feet, is now about
to be added to, in consequence of the shallowness of the
water.</p>
<p>The question now arises, would the jetty and piers have been
so beneficial, had they not been continued into the sea to the
extent alluded to?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; The shoals of sand,
which formerly existed in the offing, have been removed, or
rather have been converted into a solid mass; the current has
been diverted from a southerly to a north-easterly direction, and
the bed of the ocean nearest the shore has been elevated, and no
doubt terminates into the sea upon an inclined plane.</p>
<p>The failure of groins, erected with pile and plank, appear to
arise from their being placed in a wrong situation, from their
not extending far enough into the sea, from the piles not being
driven sufficiently into the beach, and from their sudden
elevation, present an abrupt surface for the tidal wave to play
upon, which during heavy gales of wind upon spring tides, cannot
withstand its powerful effect, should the materials lying
adjacent to or between them be removed.&nbsp; Therefore they can
only be available where the interstices are completely filled
with sea beach materials, and their durability must depend upon
the latter cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Examples</span> of Nature endeavouring to
combat with herself are shown from the immense quantity of sand,
shingle, &amp;c., brought from low to high water mark, during the
summer months, and should easterly winds prevail, the sand is
removed towards the cliffs, and accumulates in some situations
more than in others.&nbsp; Thus at Walcot, <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a> a deposition of sea beach materials
commenced in 1839, and gradually augmented from six to eight feet
in depth, within a distance of one mile and a half, and in a
space comprising a few yards, it attained a perpendicularity
above the cliffs, extending to high water mark, and the tidal
wave, even in a northerly wind, ebbed and flowed without
disturbing its surface, from the above period to November, <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>1843.&nbsp; A
gale of wind then ensued from the north-west, upon a neap tide,
which removed the greater part of the mound of sand, and a
subsequent gale, upon a spring tide, in February, 1844, swept
away the remainder.</p>
<p>A similar instance of accumulation was observed to have taken
place on the Essex coast, commencing about the same period, and
extended a distance of seven miles, which appeared in December,
1843, likely to remain. <a name="citation48a"></a><a
href="#footnote48a" class="citation">[48a]</a></p>
<p>The flat shores at Wells <a name="citation48b"></a><a
href="#footnote48b" class="citation">[48b]</a> are considerably
elevated above the depths of the ocean, into which they probably
terminate in a gradual descent.&nbsp; The stranding of three
large vessels off Winterton <a name="citation48c"></a><a
href="#footnote48c" class="citation">[48c]</a> and Horsey, <a
name="citation48d"></a><a href="#footnote48d"
class="citation">[48d]</a> years ago, have possibly prevented its
encroachments in these places.</p>
<p>When a vessel is stranded in shallow water, it usually becomes
the nucleus of a sand-bank, as has been exemplified in several of
our harbours, and this circumstance tends greatly to its
preservation.&nbsp; Between the years 1780 and 1790, a vessel
from Purbeck, laden with three hundred tons of stone, struck on a
shoal off the entrance of Poole harbour, and foundered; the crew
were saved, but the vessel and cargo remain to this day at the
bottom.&mdash;Since that period, the shoal at the entrance of the
harbour has so extended itself in a westerly direction, towards
Peveril Point, in Purbeck, that the navigable channel is thrown a
mile nearer that point.&nbsp; The cause is obvious; the tidal
current deposits the sediment with <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>which it is charged, around any
object which checks its velocity.&nbsp; Matter also drifted along
the bottom, is arrested by any obstacle, and accumulates round
it, just as the African sand-winds raise a small hillock over the
carcase of every dead camel exposed on the surface of the desert.
<a name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a"
class="citation">[49a]</a></p>
<p>Upon the 18th day of February, in the year 1807, the Hunter
cutter, <a name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b"
class="citation">[49b]</a> during a heavy gale, struck on a shoal
of sand in the offing, and finally drifted into a shallow near
the shore, about a quarter of a mile to the northward of the old
cart gap, at Hasborough, the stern part towards the cliff.&nbsp;
In a very short time, sand, shingle, &amp;c., accumulated around
her, and completely filled the shallow to its utmost
length.&nbsp; Within twelve months after, several shoals and
shallows showed themselves opposite the town gap, evincing that
the flowing of the tide had received a check, which proved an
inconvenience to fishermen, as they had to heave their boats much
farther before they could launch them into the sea; they were so
aware that the Hunter cutter was the cause of this circumstance,
that many a harsh expression did they utter towards her.&nbsp; In
less than two years, more than one hundred yards could be paced
from her bows on the ebbing of the tide to low water mark, and a
large mound of sand accumulated between her stern and the cliff,
which existed upwards of twenty years, and arrested the
devastation of the sea directly opposite.&nbsp; From subsequent
gales, however, <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>the cliffs were taken away to the northward, the water
intruded behind the mound of sand, and entirely removed it.&nbsp;
A greater proof of the check the waves had received was observed
at low water mark, a ridge of gravel was deposited and left
undisturbed on the ebbing of the tide, extending from the Hunter
cutter to Bacton coal gap, a distance of three miles to the
northward; the first spring tide, however, swept away nearly the
whole of the ridge of gravel, except that portion nearest the
Hunter cutter.</p>
<p>Although the benefit derived to the preservation of the cliffs
from the stranding of the vessel has been entirely lost, still to
the present time no shallows have formed immediately adjacent to
her, and the beach would have been higher than it now is, had her
bulwarks, taffrel, &amp;c., not been removed.</p>
<p>The irruption of the sea, through the breaches in the dunes of
sand, <a name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"

serious inconvenience and spoliation, caused a body of highly
respected and influential gentlemen to be appointed Sea-breach
Commissioners, and in the year 1804, they engaged an eminent
Engineer, since deceased, who, among other information, gave it
as his opinion, that if the shallows were all filled up, and the
beach kept on an inclined plane, the sea would never gain on the
Norfolk coast.&nbsp; He did not, however, point out how such an
assertion could be substantiated, or submit a plan to <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>effect so
desirable an object; but the accident occurring to the Hunter
cutter, the effects produced from her immersion in a cavity on
the beach, the benefit in preserving the lands opposite for a
long period, and the discontinuation of shallows forming in her
immediate neighbourhood, at once indicate the truth of his
assertion, and suggest the plan about to be submitted.</p>
<h2><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE GENERAL FEATURES OF
THE COAST.&mdash;THE VARIATION AND EFFECTS OF THE WIND FROM
DIFFERENT POINTS CONSIDERED.</span></p>
<p>To combat successfully with so restless and powerful an agent
as the ocean, requires great consideration and attention; for the
obstacles presented on this coast are of no ordinary
character.&nbsp; Among them may be enumerated powerful tides and
currents, a confined space for a large body of water upon
extraordinary occasions, cliffs of a soft yielding nature, a
limited and irregular shore, with cavities and projections,
either a dead flat or hollow descent from low water mark towards
the cliffs, constitute a beach of the worst character.&nbsp; The
shoals of sand in the offing, in certain localities, are numerous
and irregular, their dimensions and situation variable, and while
they afford a partial protection to the coast, are decidedly
injurious to vessels liable to be stranded.</p>
<p>To make the sea subservient to our wishes, and agreeable to
our design, in other words, to make it perform the duty of
bringing its contents from the bottom of its waters towards the
cliffs, to protect them, if possible, for ages, let us consider
its auxiliary, the wind, the effects, whether beneficial or
injurious.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>The
long-shore wind blowing from the north, but more particularly
from the north-west, causes the water, upon a spring tide, to
remove, as before observed, materials from the beach, to
undermine the cliffs, and should a strong breeze have continued
for two or three days previous from the south-east, and suddenly
veer to the former point, a heavier sea will be the result on
this part of the coast.&nbsp; For the waters of the ocean, having
been kept back by the south-east wind, cannot escape so readily,
had the superior force of what is commonly termed &ldquo;the
flood tide&rdquo; from the north, a tidal wave derived from the
Atlantic, not been checked.&nbsp; A small part of this wave
passes eastward up the English Channel, and through the Straits
of Dover, and then northwards, while the principal body of water,
moving much more rapidly to a more open sea on the western side
of Britain, first passes the Orkney Islands, and then turning,
flows down between Norway and Scotland, and sweeps with great
velocity along our eastern coast.</p>
<p>The lee shore wind, blowing from the north-east, removes the
shoals of sand in the offing towards the shore, and wherever
these find a resting place, from the suddenness of their removal,
quicksands are sure to exist; fortunately, however, not to so
considerable a depth as mentioned by the celebrated Scottish
Bard, in the fate attending the Master of Ravensworth, but yet
sufficiently alarming to render persons cautious how they venture
upon their surface, especially on horseback.&nbsp; Wind blowing
from the east produces these effects to a greater extent than
from the north-east, and wind blowing from the south-east causes
the sand on the sea-shore to be extremely loose and porous, while
the north wind renders the sand firm, solid, and compact.&nbsp;
Some years since, on one occasion, after the formation of these
sands, a vessel laden with timber, was stranded at Trimingham,
near Cromer.&nbsp; A waggon and horses being employed to convey
the timber ashore, became immersed, and the latter could not be
extricated, on account of their being attached <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>to the
waggon, until life was extinct.&nbsp; On the same day, a lady,
riding on horseback between Horsey and Waxham, met with a similar
accident, and was with difficulty released from her perilous
situation.&nbsp; When the wind changes to another quarter, these
sands disappear, and shoals are visible in their former
situation.</p>
<p>Too often does the unfortunate mariner experience the bitter
effects of quicksands in immediate connection with the large
shoal off Hasborough: while the surface on its inner side is
covered with water eighteen or twenty inches deep, within a short
distance is as many fathoms.&nbsp; Between the spaces loose sands
exist to a great depth; and, therefore, only those well
acquainted with this circumstance, can possibly escape
destruction, for should a vessel strike the fore part of her keel
on the more solid portion of the shoal, numerous instances can be
adduced where the stern has sunk foremost into the quicksands,
and hull, masts, and every thing belonging to her, have been
engulphed in a very short time, and sometimes, probably, before
those on board have had an opportunity to make their escape.</p>
<p>An off-shore wind on this coast blows from west to south, and
causes all heavy bodies, stones, &amp;c., to be brought towards
the shore; which are left between high and low water mark on the
ebbing of the tide.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE GENERAL FEATURE OF
THE CLIFFS CONSIDERED&mdash;CAUSES OF IRREGULARITY, AND THE
GEOLOGICAL STRATA COMPOSING THEM.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cliffs <a
name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a> extending from Hasborough to or a
little beyond Cromer, are found, upon approaching near, to be
extremely irregular.&nbsp; In some places small promontories or
points project, in others small bays are formed, according to the
influence of the sea, and the materials composing their
structure.&nbsp; Their perpendicularity is partially averted from
the fallen masses deposited at their base; which, where the
cliffs are lofty, are often considerable; arising either from the
sand or clay beneath the more solid strata being removed; or the
landslips which ensue, from fresh water springs abounding in
certain localities.&nbsp; Thus, in the winter of 1825, a fallen
mass was precipitated from near the light-house at Cromer, which
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>covered
twelve acres, extending far into the sea, the cliffs being two
hundred and fifty feet in height; and Mr. Lyell observes, the
undermining by springs has caused large portions of the upper
part of the cliffs, with houses still standing upon them, to give
way, so that it is impossible, by erecting breakwaters at the
base of the cliffs, permanently to ward off the danger.</p>
<p>The wasting of the cliffs is also accelerated from other
causes&mdash;the continuation of strong north-easterly winds, of
drought producing fissures from their superior surface downwards,
heavy rains, and after severe and successive frosts.</p>
<p>The cliffs generally consist of clay, sand, and loam.&nbsp; By
some writers they have been termed mud cliffs, from their dark
colour and general appearance.&nbsp; Mr. Lyell includes them in a
series called the Boulder formation.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodward, in his Outline of the Geology of Norfolk,
considers them to be of diluvial origin; but upon close
inspection, they are found to contain strata and fossils which
partake of the characters and may be ascribed to various parts of
the tertiary period.</p>
<p>The cliffs form part of an extensive series, extending from

comprising a distance of about twenty miles, and are supposed
continuously to rest upon chalk.</p>
<p>In some places the cliffs are very regularly stratified,
presenting at various parts, layers of red and white sand, but in
other places they are wholly devoid of stratification, exhibiting
one continuous mass of till.</p>

<p>The entire series of these cliffs bears evidence of great and
successive changes; the strata, in many places, are folded and
bent, and superimposed upon others, which have undergone no
dislocation whatever.&nbsp; On the till, with an even horizontal
surface, beds of laminated clay and sand are seen to repose,
succeeded by vertical, bent, and contorted beds, having a
covering of coarse gravel and flints.</p>
<p>Between Bacton and Mundsley, small pits or furrows may be seen
at various distances, from the top of the cliffs filled with
fragments of white chalk; regular strata being
superimposed.&nbsp; Many of these furrows are several feet in
width and depth.&nbsp; In the till, to the east of Bacton, these
furrows are again largely developed.</p>
<p>The till and marl, layers of which are met with towards
Mundsley, frequently present grooved surfaces, and at different
places appear to dip into the beach, the grooves left being
filled with superimposed sand.&nbsp; The gravel also takes a like
dip.</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>While
on the one hand there are evidences which prove the slow
deposition of some of these strata, on the other there are proofs
of great convulsions and derangement.</p>
<p>As a regular description of the separate strata may not prove
uninteresting, let us inquire into the first&mdash;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Till</span>.</h3>
<p>This term is a provincial word, widely used in Scotland for
similar masses of unstratified matter, which contain boulders;
and the same term has been applied by Mr. Lyell to this part of
the Norfolk strata.</p>
<p>The till is of a dark blue colour, somewhat resembling that of
the London clay, and has been classed by some writers with that
formation, because of the boulders with which it abounds.&nbsp;
Mr. Woodward calls it blue clay.&nbsp; A positive distinction
between this and the regular blue clay, however, must be
made.</p>
<p>This till forms a large portion of the cliffs between
Hasborough and Mundsley, rising in some places from twenty to
nearly eighty feet in perpendicular height.&mdash;The whole of
its organic remains appears to have been washed from other
formations, to be deposited in it, and it contains, mingled with
them, fragments of almost every rock of the secondary and primary
series; comprehending immense blocks of granite, porphry,
greenstone, oolite, lias, chalk, pebbles, trap, micaceous chist,
sand-stones of various kinds, chert, marl, &amp;c.&nbsp; Near
Hasborough it is much intermingled with chalk.</p>
<p>The second stratum, as we descend beneath the till, is the</p>
<h3><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span><span
class="smcap">Crag</span>.</h3>
<p>A layer of which, between the watch-house and coal gaps at
Bacton, has been termed by Mr. Lyell hard ferruginous crag.&nbsp;
It consists of several thin plates, containing compressed wood,
fragmentary and whole shells, intermixed with clay, gravel, and
white sand.&nbsp; This bed forms a dip towards the north-west,
having a support of red sand on the one side, and green sand on
the other.&nbsp; A section of the crag is more largely developed
at Cromer, Runton, and Weybourne.&nbsp; Between Bacton coal gap
and Mundsley, vertical layers of crag occur, composed of thickly
cemented fragments of shells.</p>
<p>Immediately beneath the crag occur those formations which are
generally termed Fresh Water, consisting of lignite and
lacustrine deposits.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Lacustrine</span>.</h3>
<p>At several spots between Hasborough and Mundsley, these
deposits may be examined.&nbsp; They contain many species of
shells, with fish and bones of mammalia.</p>
<p>The first of these occurs at a place called Ostend, between
Hasborough and Bacton, about half a mile from the latter
place.&nbsp; It is composed of bluish mud, with occasional
patches of brown clay, and extends several yards along the
beach.&nbsp; This formation was discovered by Mr. Green, in
August, 1841.</p>
<p>About two hundred yards from the forest peat at Bacton, the
second lacustrine bed occurs.&nbsp; It is confined to <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>occasional
patches about the middle of the cliff, near the watch-house
gap.&nbsp; The shells are deposited in thin layers of sand and
blue clay, containing much wood, which appears as if bored by
some insect.</p>
<p>The third lacustrine formation is at the village of Mundsley,
and is distinguished from the other cliffs by its dark muddy
appearance.&nbsp; Its height is about twenty feet, and it extends
one hundred yards along the beach.</p>
<p>Mr. Lyell, referring to this bed, says, &ldquo;It consists of
brown, black, and grey sand, and loam mixed with vegetable
matter, sometimes almost passing into a kind of peaty earth,
containing much pyrites.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Lignite</span>.</h3>
<p>This name has been given to extensive forest beds, containing
much carbonized wood.</p>
<p>The deposit prevails very generally along the Norfolk coast,
and may be instructively examined at Hasborough, Bacton,
Mundsley, Trimingham, and Cromer.</p>
<p>At Bacton extensive sections are laid bare after high
tides.&nbsp; They are mostly formed of black peaty earth, which
may be separated into thin layers, and has generally an aluminous
taste, and abounds with pyrites.</p>
<p>At Bacton the depth of these sections, from the top of the
cliff, is about five feet; at Ostend, between Bacton and
Hasborough, about thirty, and at Mundsley, one hundred feet.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>These
deposits are occasionally mixed with masses of red sand,
containing pipes of hard clay.</p>
<p>This formation presents the appearance of a wood, having been
overthrown and crushed in situ; for after strong north-west
winds, the stumps of the trees may be seen really standing, with
their strong roots extended, and intermingling with each
other.&nbsp; In the winter of 1840&ndash;41, Mr. Green measured
some of these trunks, which were then exposed about a foot from
the root.&mdash;One measured five feet eleven inches round, and
the other five feet.</p>
<p>Whilst at Bacton this bed is formed of black peaty earth, at
Ostend it is mixed with a greenish sand.&nbsp; Mr. Lyell speaks
of that at Hasborough as &ldquo;laminated blue clay, about one
foot and a half in thickness, part of the clay being bituminous,
and inclosing compressed branches and leaves of trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. R. C. Taylor, in his Geology of Eastern Norfolk, observes
of the deposit generally:&mdash;&ldquo;It consists of forest
peat, containing fir cones and fragments of bones; in others of
woody clay; and elsewhere, of large stools of trees, standing
thickly together, the stems appearing to have been broken off
about eighteen inches from the base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. James Layton, cited by Mr. Fairholme in his Geology,
states, in a letter, &ldquo;the line of crushed wood, leaves,
grass, &amp;c., frequently forming a bed of peat, extends just
above low water mark.&nbsp; About this stratum, numerous remains
of mammalia are found, the horns and bones of at least four kinds
of deer, the horse, the ox, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and
elephant.&nbsp; These fossil <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>remains are found at Hasborough and
its neighbourhood, on the denuded clay shore.&nbsp; At Mundsley,
they are found in the cliff.&nbsp; This stratum may be seen as
the underlying formation, along the whole line of beach from
Eccles to Mundsley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Cromer, Mr. Simons has observed, beneath the drift, several
feet below high water mark, a bed of lignite, in which were found
the seeds of plants, &amp;c.&nbsp; He also observed ten or more
trees, in the space of half an acre, exposed below the cliffs
eastward of that town, the stumps being a few inches, all less
than a foot, in vertical height, some no less than nine or ten
feet in girth, the roots spreading from them on all sides,
throughout a space of twenty feet in diameter.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Taylor believes this bed, as visible at
Hasborough, to be an extension of the well-known stratum at
Watton cliff and Harwich.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;evidence sufficient to prove that it extends more south
than Palling, even as low down as Winterton, and Caister; also at
Lowestoft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two last strata nearest the chalk are the</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Blue Clay and the Red Gravel</span>.</h3>
<p>These two beds &ldquo;seem to have been deposited
contemporaneously, as they are much intermixed, and every where
contain the same species of mammalian remains.&nbsp; From the
unusual quantity of bones contained in these strata, they have
been provincially termed the Bone Rocks, but from the immense
quantity of elephants&rsquo; bones annually exhumed, they may,
for the sake of distinction, <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>be termed the Elephant
Beds.&rdquo;&nbsp; In some places the blue clay is deposited upon
the red gravel.</p>
<p>The red gravel appears to be composed of rolled materials,
which no doubt have been brought to this place from some
distance.&nbsp; It comprehends a mixture of red sand and gravel,
ferruginous and ochraceous nodules; blue clay, peat, sulphur,
loam, flints, pebbles, masses of granite, porphry, fragments of
and whole bones, and is much mineralized by iron.</p>
<p>These rocks are traceable to a considerable distance beyond
Cromer.</p>
<p>The immediate bed upon which the strata rests appears to
be</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chalk</span>.</h3>
<p>This is met with about half a mile north-west of Mundsley,
about low water mark, and for upwards of a mile forms the
beach.&nbsp; Near Trimingham three very remarkable protuberances,
which rise up and form a part of lofty cliffs.&nbsp; Further
northward, masses of chalk are included in the drift, or crop out
in the interior, at a short distance from the shore, as at
Overstrand, near Cromer, where a pit has been worked, in which
the chalk is in a very disturbed and shattered state.&nbsp; At
Cromer, the chalk has been again detected, and is every where the
fundamental rock, lying about the level of low water, and rising
on the north of that town, to the height of some yards above the
level.&nbsp; At Sherringham it ascends above high water mark, and
enters largely, from thence to Weybourne, into the strata of the
cliffs.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>From
the appearance then of so much chalk in the immediate
neighbourhood, and some of it apparently in an undisturbed state,
as may be seen by its horizontal layers of flint at Sherringham,
beyond doubt its existence may be concluded both to the east as
well as the north.</p>
<p>In the year 1836, the humerus bone probably of the Great
Mastodon, was found at Bacton, after a very high tide, one side
of which, from the appearance it presents, must have reposed upon
chalk.&nbsp; This bone was discovered in the red gravel, which,
in many places, is the nearest bed to the chalk.&nbsp; Fragments
of chalk are attached to the bone.</p>
<p>In the early part of this year the tibia probably of the same
animal, was exposed, and obtained after a high tide by Mr. Green,
in whose possession it still remains.</p>

WITH PLAN TO COUNTERACT THEM.&mdash;REDUCTION OF THE CLIFFS
CONSIDERED ADVISABLE, ESPECIALLY WHERE GREAT IRREGULARITIES IN
SAND DUNES EXIST, WITH A PLAN TO INCREASE THEIR HEIGHT WHERE
NECESSARY.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> considered the cliffs with
respect to the contour they present, the different strata
composing their structure, the injury they experience from the
atmospheric air, from drought, from heavy rains, from severe and
successive frosts, and from the formidable visitations of the
German Ocean against their base; yet, they possess an internal
enemy peculiar to themselves, which in certain localities is more
formidable than the ocean itself&mdash;these are the Land-springs
previously alluded to.</p>
<p>To check their baneful influence is a task that requires
consideration, for although we know their existence, we cannot
tell whether they arise from a broad or a narrow surface, at a
great depth, or at a considerable distance from whence they are
seen to issue; and although so serious in their consequences, yet
the extent arising from such contingencies, on this part of the
coast, is generally limited.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>Wherever they abound, the cliffs ought, where
practicable, to be reduced from a perpendicular to an inclined
plane; then let stakes, or rather strong piles, be driven in a
parallel direction to the extent required, and sufficiently deep
into the solid strata beneath, at short distances one from
another, with splines fastened horizontally, or what would be
preferable, strong wooden faggots interposed between the piles
and the cliffs, especially where the materials consist of a loose
texture; these would be found efficient, until a more natural,
solid, and lasting support could be obtained.</p>
<p>Great benefit might be derived by sinking wells on the inner
or land side of the cliffs, subjected to their influence; for at
Trimingham, the loss of four acres and a half of land, mentioned
in a previous chapter, is primarily attributed to a foolish
individual, who a few months before filled up three wells in the
immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The question now comes&mdash;would it not be advisable to
remove generally, where practicable, the taller,
cliffs?&mdash;Possibly it would.</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; The air in heavy gales of wind would not be so much
condensed against their base, and add so much weight to the waves
when nearing the shore as is now evidently the case, and the
latter would be less liable to disarrange the legitimate beach
during its formation.</p>
<p>2ndly.&nbsp; Wherever land-springs abound, an egress for the
fresh water would ensue, without causing shoots of land to take
place, where the former exist beyond or rather above the reach of
the stakes recommended, which might retard the formation of the
legitimate beach.</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>3rdly.&mdash;It will be decidedly applicable, where
dunes or hills of blown sand from their irregularity, produced
from the north-east winds, are reduced to an extent liable to
admit an irruption of the sea, observable at Eccles, Palling,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>And lastly.&nbsp; The application of a plough in a locality
where such fissures exist, upon the plan recommended in the
ensuing chapter; and due attention to the transplanting the
marram <a name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a> from time to time as required, will
accomplish the rest without directly interfering with the land
belonging to private individuals on the inner side of those
banks.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE AUTHOR&rsquo;S PLAN
FOR EVENTUALLY COUNTERACTING THE INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF THE GERMAN
OCEAN ALONG THE EASTERN COAST OF NORFOLK, COMPRISED WITHIN A
DISTANCE OF THIRTY MILES, EXTENDING FROM WINTERTON-NESS TO OR A
LITTLE BEYOND CROMER.&mdash;A PLAN FOR THE ERECTION OF JETTIES
SUBMITTED, &amp;C.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> knowledge gained upon this
interesting subject, the instances adverted to in the former
chapter, prove almost beyond a doubt, that the
question&mdash;Whether art can arrest the progress of the German
Ocean along the Norfolk coast? may be answered in the
affirmative.</p>
<p>The first and greatest desideratum necessary to be obtained is
a bold shore, formed by a legitimate beach, a term applied by the
eminent engineer, previously alluded to, who stated its ascent
should be three inches and a half in the yard, which would
realize seventeen feet and a half in two hundred and ten yards; a
height which no sea upon this coast could ever reach.</p>
<p>From there being plenty of materials in the offing, the ascent
could be more gradual, which would be preferable, for a two-fold
object must be kept in view; the one, for the preservation of the
lands in the interior; the other, for the safety of mariners,
should misfortune attend and <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>compel them to run their vessel
ashore.&nbsp; Besides the more abruptly a body presents itself,
whether natural or artificial, to the almost irresistible force
of the tidal wave, when called into excessive action, the less it
is likely to remain stable and compact.&nbsp; It will therefore
be necessary to ascertain the extent of the shoals existing in
the offing, and the elevation likely to be realized may easily be
calculated.</p>
<p>A single row of piles driven into the beach at right angles to
the shore, wherever a shallow exists, will be sufficient, with
plank fastened to them, to encourage the materials, brought by
the tidal wave and current, to be retained and lodged against
them.&nbsp; The length of the piles necessary, must depend upon
the supposed elevation required, taking into consideration, not
only the depth of the sand lying at the bottom of the shallow,
but also the strata beneath.&nbsp; In a very short time, by
gradually adding the plank, the shallow will become filled up,
and the tidal wave will pass over without disturbing its surface,
the same plan must be adopted wherever a shallow exists at low
water mark, but possibly the difficulty of applying the plank in
that situation cannot be so easily accomplished; consequently a
greater number of piles will be required, as they must be
inserted near to each other.</p>
<p>After a shallow has been filled to the level of the beach then
existing, and the upper part of the pile still projecting, let
plank, if necessary, be gradually added about one or two feet in
breadth at a time, as the deposition accumulates.</p>
<p>Proceeding onwards into the sea as opportunity offers, <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>some portion
of the shoals will be removed into the shallows; another,
probably, will be carried towards the cliffs.&nbsp; To facilitate
this object, let a long tined harrow be fastened to the stern of
a boat, which being urged by men, will loosen the materials on
the surface of a shoal; and the flowing of the water will carry
them, if the wind is in a favourable quarter, towards the shore,
and thus will the beach become a consolidated body, with
superabundant materials deposited at high water mark: these of
course must be removed towards the cliffs.&nbsp; If the materials
consist principally of sand, a plough might be employed with
considerable advantage, turning the furrows inward towards the
cliffs; on the contrary, should stones predominate, they must be
deposited at the base of the cliffs.&nbsp; Easterly winds will
remove the loose dry sand towards and fill up the spaces between
them.&nbsp; Many suggestions, however, to expedite the work will
present themselves upon inspection and trial. <a
name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a></p>
<p>The distance required from one row of piles to another must
also depend upon circumstances.&nbsp; Wherever the sea reaches
in, should a shallow or flat exist, there piles will be
necessary, as well as to the southward of it, which will greatly
accelerate the deposition of materials where they are so much
required.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Discrimination will also be necessary in the application of
the piles; for a minute and continuous observer will perceive it
frequently happens, the alteration of a current and the wind
favouring it, the sea will reach in towards the cliffs, and
undermine and excavate one locality, while <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>another,
previously visited, will become filled up by materials dislodged
from the former place. <a name="citation71"></a><a
href="#footnote71" class="citation">[71]</a>&nbsp; In the latter
instance, piles will not be required to be applied immediately,
for probably some of the materials, irregularly accumulated, will
be requisite to be shifted to their former situation.&nbsp; Hence
the reason of applying piles to the southward and not to the
northward of a locality requiring immediate assistance.</p>
<p>Again, considerable difference in the insertion of the piles
must be made according to the contour the beach presents; between
a distance continuously flat, and a shallow that only requires to
be filled up.&nbsp; In the latter a few piles inserted from west
to east, will answer extremely well; in the former, an opposite
direction must be pursued; that is, from the north-west to the
south-east, according to the accompanying plate, for the sweep of
the water must be taken into consideration, and also the
necessity for encouraging sea-beach materials to accumulate to
the southward of a groin, as well as to the northward.&nbsp; Upon
this our final success depends.</p>
<p>While the above plan presents the least resistance to the
tidal wave when most agitated, the tidal current will be checked
and rendered powerless, and the gradual elevation, from the
deposition of materials, will produce the effects exhibited by
the breaking of the waves on a shelving shore; and, as they roll
onwards, their power <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>will become diminished, by wanting
weight and depth to aid their motion.</p>
<p>In several places on this beach, the sand, shingle, &amp;c.,
do not exceed four feet in depth, and in some instances are still
shallower; thus at Cromer, a large body of calcareous deposition
exists, and projects above the beach at low water mark; but
between that and the cliffs, now temporarily protected by a sea
wall, a shallow or cavity of considerable length and depth must
have existed: this induced the inhabitants, who had witnessed the
good the jetty had effected (previous to the injury Cromer
sustained, and alluded to in a former chapter), to insert a groin
immediately to the southward, or rather westward, of the town,
eighty-four yards in length.</p>
<p>The shallow or cavity became filled up to the top of the
groin, and a quantity of sea-beach material, consisting
principally of sand, seemed disposed to accumulate against the
base of the walls in June, 1844, but unfortunately the groin was
not sufficiently extended towards the sea; the piles, instead of
projecting above, did not equal in height the mound alluded to,
and consequently it is not so efficacious as it would otherwise
have been.</p>
<p>The jetty too has some influence towards prohibiting a still
further proof of the efficacy of this groin, at least along shore
to the northward, or rather eastward; for rude in construction,
it is ill calculated to effect a twofold object, which ought to
arise from it.&nbsp; The platform resting upon piles of huge
dimensions in height and diameter, appears to have been one
continuous length, from the base of the cliffs to the elevated
rock at low water mark.&nbsp; Its considerable altitude above the
surface of the <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>beach, its unwieldy structure, from the timbers
employed, and above all, its extent towards the sea being
limited, accounts for its partial destruction in the storm
alluded to.&nbsp; The dashing of the waves against the piles,
even in calm weather, gives an impetus to the water at their
base, and produces eddies or whirlpools, which prevent sea-beach
materials accumulating in the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>The inhabitants, however, appear so far to have been aware of
this circumstance, that in repairing the jetty, they had recourse
to iron stanchions, presenting a flat surface towards the sea;
but the same impediment to utility still exists.</p>
<p>Let us now consider whether a jetty could not be constructed
to afford not only a delightful promenade, the necessary
appendage to a frequented watering place, but the retention of
sea-beach materials, and the consequent elevation of the
beach.</p>
<p>For this purpose let wooden piles of English oak be employed,
of requisite length to enter the solid strata beneath the surface
of the beach.&nbsp; The extremity for insertion must be pointed
and shod with iron, and the opposite end must be protected with a
rim of the same material, which ought to project above each pile,
so as to leave a cavity sufficiently deep to receive the one end
of an iron pillar, about eight or more inches in diameter, if
considered necessary; and the length of this iron pillar being
determined, its upper part can be readily formed to support the
wooden plank constituting the platform of the jetty, to which it
can be fastened.&nbsp; Now, if the piles are inserted into the
beach in a continuous range towards the sea, leaving a space
between each pillar, from two <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>to three feet apart, it may readily
be inferred, that the desirable object will be realized, and a
permanent good will be obtained.&nbsp; The expense, in the first
instance, will of course be considerable, but its durability and
usefulness ought to supersede such an obstacle.</p>
<p>It is a source of congratulation to observe considerable
economy in the expenditure which so great an undertaking
requires, can be effected by using, in a general way, the Pinus
Sylvestris, or red fir, grown in the neighbouring plantations; <a
name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a> these, if taken down in the winter
months, trimming them, and depositing them in the sea, in
readiness for insertion as opportunity suits, will retain their
resinous properties in the greatest abundance, and prevent the
exudation, which an exposure to the spring and summer months
would inevitably produce.&nbsp; Upon the resin they contain their
toughness depends, and by adopting the above plan, and using
those small in diameter, the instrument necessary for propelling
them into the beach, will not disturb the surface of the pile
most exposed to its influence.&nbsp; The following instance will
prove their durability, and that a careful insertion of the piles
is only necessary to render their stability certain, even if
extraordinary gales should cause the legitimate beach to be
disturbed.</p>
<p>At Mundsley, several years ago, not within the memory of the
oldest inhabitant, some fishermen drove four piles, six inches in
diameter, into the beach, between high <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>and low water mark, for the purpose
of forming what is termed a coy, for containing lobsters caught
at sea, until an opportunity for their disposal occurred.&nbsp;
To the piles were attached some boards, so as to form a square,
within which was placed a box for their reception; and a piece of
wood, fastened upon the top, prevented the box from being
disturbed by the water.&nbsp; At length, however, it became
disused, the boards attached to the piles gave way, but the
latter still remain firmly imbedded in the strata beneath, and
their tops are only visible when north and north-west winds
prevail, the sand lying around, above, and between them being
then removed.</p>
<p>The shipowner, and above all the hardy sailor, cannot but
rejoice at the prospect of obtaining a broad beach upon an
inclined plane, for should a vessel be driven on in ever so heavy
a gale, instead of having to contend with the cheerless prospect
now before them, rendered not only formidable, but terrible, from
the numerous shoals existing on this coast, there would be only
one, and the vessel would arrive at its destination in a more
gradual manner; her keel would become almost immediately impacted
in the sand to such an extent, as to render her steady; for the
waves having to attain an ascent, would be checked in their
career, and for want of depth, would neither be able to injure
the vessel nor destroy the mariner: hitherto, the great power
they possess has, in many instances, dashed the former to pieces
after she had struck the beach, and the latter has been hurled
towards it, either too suddenly, or by their rebounding, swept
into the depths below; while he, poor creature, so long as
consciousness or presence of mind exists, uses his feeble efforts
to reach the blessed shore, but, alas! too frequently in vain; he
either sinks, to be wafted to another, <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>a lifeless, mangled corpse, or
arrives too late to be saved, even if the vibration of the heart
exists, for want of proper accommodation and attention.&nbsp; If
a legitimate beach could be once formed, a little exertion and
assistance from those on shore, would be able to rescue him from
the now almost inevitable destruction.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="GutSmall">THE
CONCLUSION.</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> not the plan proposed in the
previous chapter make too hasty an impression, or cause the
reader to be too sanguine as to the result, however it may bear
the semblance to truth and reality; but, if upon inquiry,
consideration, and inspection, it is found to originate in facts,
not theory alone, let no longer time be wasted in delaying a
trial of its efficacy than is really necessary.</p>
<p>For a series of years, the wondrous body of waters has
committed most dreadful ravages upon this and other coasts, not
only to the loss of property, but what is of far greater
consequence, human life.</p>
<p>Many countries, that have been destroyed, bear melancholy
witness to the truth of history, and show the tops of their
houses and the spires of their steeples, still standing at the
bottom of the water.&nbsp; The German Sea has advanced upon the
shores of Holland near Catt, that the ruins of an ancient citadel
of the Romans, which was formerly built upon the coast, are now
actually under water.&nbsp; In Friezland and Zealand, there are
more than three hundred villages overwhelmed, and their ruins
continue still visible on a clear day.&nbsp; The Baltic Sea has
by <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>slow
degrees covered a large part of Pomerania, and among others
destroyed and overwhelmed the famous port of Vineta.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable inundations recorded in history,
occurred in the reign of Henry I., which overwhelmed the estates
of the Earl Godwin, and formed the bank now called the Goodwin
Sands.</p>
<p>In the year 1546, a similar irruption of the sea destroyed a
thousand persons in the territory of Dort, and a yet greater
number round Dullart.&nbsp; To these accidents several more might
be added; our own historians and those of other countries abound
with them; almost every flat shore of any extent being able to
show something it has lost, or something it has gained from the
sea.</p>
<p>There are some shores on which the sea, where it has
overflowed, and after remaining perhaps some ages, has again
retired of its own accord, or been driven back by the industry of
man, which, if applied in the case submitted, would, we earnestly
pray, verify the words contained in the 5th chapter of the
prophet Jeremiah, and the 22nd verse.&nbsp; And should this
design be found to answer, who is there can deny that, by
continued attention and perseverance, not only will the lands in
future be protected, but those which now appear lost, may in
after years be regained, and that the saving of human life will
be considerable.</p>
<p>There are many lands in Norway, Scotland, and the Maldivia
Islands, that are at one time covered with water, at another time
free.&nbsp; The country round the Isle of Ely, in the time of
Bede, about a thousand years ago, was <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>one of the most delightful spots in
the whole kingdom; it was not only cultivated, and produced all
the necessaries of life, but grapes also, that afforded excellent
wine.&nbsp; The accounts of the time are copious in the
description of its verdure and fertility, its rich pastures
covered with flowers and herbage, its beautiful shades and
wholesome air.&nbsp; But the sea breaking in upon the land,
overwhelmed the whole country, took possession of the soil, and
totally destroyed one of the most fertile vallies in the world;
its air, from being dry and healthful, from that time became
unwholesome, and the small part of the country, which by being
higher than the rest escaped the deluge, was soon rendered
uninhabitable from its noxious vapours.&nbsp; The island
continued under water some centuries, till at last the sea, by
the same caprice which had prompted its invasion, began to
abandon the earth in like manner.&nbsp; It has continued for some
ages to relinquish its former conquests; and although the
inhabitants can neither boast the longevity nor the luxuries of
the original possessors, yet they find ample means of
subsistence, and if they happen to survive the first years of
residence there, they are often known to arrive at a good old
age.</p>
<p>On this coast several manors and large portions of the
neighbouring parishes have been swallowed up; nor has there been
any intermission, from time immemorial, in the ravages of the sea
within a distance of twenty miles in length in which these places
stood.</p>
<p>Many a poor fisherman has lost his life within sight of his
parents, wife, and children, whose uplifted hands, streaming
eyes, and shrieks of wild despair, proclaimed the pangs they
endured, the agony they suffered, at losing <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>their
offspring, their husband, their father; and this too, when the
tenderest ties of affection endeared them to each other; on a
sudden lost, gone for ever! leaving those behind, who, if not
bereaved of their senses entirely, remain during their sojourn in
this vale of tears, for ever broken-hearted and
disconsolate.&nbsp; This gloomy picture may appear over-drawn;
but, alas! it is too true and melancholy to think of, where such
accidents are frequent, and likely to continue till time shall be
no more.&nbsp; But there is a ray of hope, that the object which
appears so difficult to accomplish, may eventually be attained by
the industry of man, with the means given and transmitted from
the acquisition of knowledge, through an Allwise and Merciful
Creator.&nbsp; Let us earnestly pray that His blessing may be
bestowed upon our humble endeavours, to the fulfilment of this or
a superior design.</p>

81</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>BACTON.</h3>
<p>Bacton or Backton, termed in the Doomsday Book Baketuna, is
situated about four miles and a half north-east by east of North
Walsham.&nbsp; From bordering on the sea, it continually
experiences its devastating effects, which is the more to be
regretted, as the land, about 1600 acres, is extremely
fertile.</p>
<p>The Church, dedicated to St. Andrew, is a neat edifice,
situated on elevated ground, about a quarter of a mile distant
from the sea; and the interior, though unadorned with costly
monuments, contains several neat stones to record departed
worth.</p>
<p>The venerable relic of Norman grandeur Broomholme Priory,
generally termed Bacton Abbey, is situated in the centre of the
village, and from its being in a better state of preservation
than probably any other in this county, which possesses the
astonishing number of one hundred and twenty-two, is ever a
source of interest to the lovers of antiquity.</p>
<p>The architectural style of the Priory of Broomholme appears to
be that of the Norman and the early or lancet gothic united.</p>
<p>The editor of the General History of the County of Norfolk
says: &ldquo;A part of its architecture is so entirely of the
same style as Norwich Cathedral, that it can scarcely be doubted
but they are of the same era.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The north transept, with its triforium arches, many of which
still remain, bears some resemblance to those of Norwich
Cathedral and the Church of St. Nicholas, Yarmouth.</p>
<p>The churches generally were built in the form of the latin
cross, terminating at the end in a semi-circular apsis.&nbsp; The
internal elevations consisted of three divisions, the lower
arches&mdash;the triforium, <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>occupying the space between the
vaulting and external roof of the side aisles&mdash;and the
celestory.</p>
<p>The circular arched entrance north of the transept appears to
be built of Caen stone, and though plain, attests the origin of
at least this part of the building.&nbsp; To the east a very
lofty arch presents itself of the early gothic.</p>
<p>The chapter-house has a very large window of the early pointed
gothic, supposed to have been added in the reign of Henry the
VII, but it appears of a much earlier date.</p>
<p>The arcades of the face of the interior walls are very plain
and simple; and are intended to take off the effect of a large
extent of plain surface as the windows are but small.&nbsp; This
appears to have been general in all Norman architecture.</p>
<p>The chimney is very modern, as the builders of the middle ages
gave the preference to warming their halls by a central hearth,
leaving the smoke to blacken the roof and escape as it best might
by an open lantern.</p>
<p>The niche in the north transept, which bears traces of the
ornamental gothic, was probably added with other parts of the
building, as the abbey increased in fame and opulence.</p>
<p>The following are the supposed dimensions of the various
buildings, &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>

<p>This priory was founded in 1113, by William de Glanville, in
the reign of Henry the First, for monks of the order of Cluni, as
a cell to Castleacre priory.&nbsp; Here the monks of the latter
sent their junior brethren, when too much crowded at home, or
refractory monks, to do penance for non compliance with monastic
rules.&nbsp; Subsequently, Bartholomew de Glanville, who was
Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, confirmed the priory of
Castleacre to this priory.&mdash;The first prior was inducted to
the abbey in the reign of Henry the First, and the last in the
reign of Henry the Eighth.</p>
<p>The monks attached to this establishment appear, according to
early historians, to have derived great profit from a cross, said
to have been made out of that part of the Saviour&rsquo;s cross
to which the hands and feet were attached, particularly the part
where it was most sprinkled with his blood; and Capgrave informs
us, &ldquo;that no fewer than thirty-nine were raised from the
dead, and nineteen blind persons had their sight restored by
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>In this
priory were also preserved the &ldquo;girdle for Zona, and milk
of the blessed Virgin, and fragments of the crosses of St. Peter
and St. Andrew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the rage for relics in former times, that Mabillon, a
Benedictine, complained that the altars were loaded with
counterfeits; numerous spurious ones being every where offered to
the piety and devotion of the faithful.&nbsp; He also observes,
&ldquo;that bones were often consecrated, which so far from
belonging to the saints, probably never belonged to
Christians!&rdquo;&nbsp; To shew how far this fraud extended, the
&ldquo;girdle&rdquo; of the Virgin Mary, said to have been
possessed by the monastery of Broomholme, was shown to the
visitors appointed by Henry the Eighth, in eleven different
places.</p>
<p>The following &ldquo;Legendary Fragment,&rdquo; written by an
intimate friend of the Author&rsquo;s, may not be deemed
inappropriate:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Broomholme, thy ruined grandeur tells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A saddening tale of man&rsquo;s decay,<br />
It speaks how all his glories pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How all his relics droop away;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; To Desolation&rsquo;s ruthless reign,<br />
How all the records he would trace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hand of Time outblots again.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And seen the unwearying ebb and flow<br />
Of yonder calm and azure sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glittering in summer&rsquo;s golden glow;<br />
And oh! how many a winter&rsquo;s snow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath wrapped thee in its spotless vest,<br />
How many a Spring with cheerful hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy fair domain in beauty drest.</p>
<p class="poetry">How oft within thy ruined fane<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has many a haughty zealot knelt,<br />
And muttered o&rsquo;er some holy prayer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His thankless heart had never felt:<br />
Thou&rsquo;st heard the groans of souls that melt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With anguish and repentance cleft,<br />
Who, though engulphed in blood and crime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had yet the hope of mercy left.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! could yon gloomy pile reveal<br />

<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twould tell of horrors dark and dire,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; That well the sternest heart might thrill,<br />
How man with rapine, sword, and fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had wrought with zeal his brother&rsquo;s ill.<br />
Strange that ungrateful man should fill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cup of woe, for pride or pelf,<br />
Yet madly, fondly, vainly hope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To taste the streams of bliss himself.</p>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twould tell how bright, to
Childhood&rsquo;s eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The glory of existence seems,<br />
How swiftly life&rsquo;s ensuing hours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lose one by one their golden gleams.<br />
How fondly Hope&rsquo;s delusive dreams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hearts of men with smiles enslave,<br />
How those forlorn and weary here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May learn to look beyond the grave.</p>
<p class="poetry">And Fancy often wanders back,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through Time on her enchanted wings,<br />

In every withered leafless bough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dirge of the departed year;<br />
And the lone sea-bird&rsquo;s dismal wail,<br />
That ever comes in storm and gale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Foretells the gathering tempest near.</p>
<p class="poetry">The gloom of night is deepening fast,<br />
And on the wild and fitful blast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stormy clouds like shadows fly;<br />
And darkened by their rapid flight,<br />
The pale and placid orb of night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is shrouded from the seaman&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p class="poetry">The vivid lightning&rsquo;s transient flash,<br

And then the deafening thunder crash,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Proclaims the elemental war;<br />

And when the rolling thunder dies,<br />

<p class="poetry">The wild waves that in wanton play<br />
Fling to the winds their feather&rsquo;d spray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But seem to mock the angry sky;<br />
But seem to sport in maddening pride,<br />
When all is dread and dark beside,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ghastly Death is hovering nigh.</p>

<p class="poetry">Morn: oh! how many anxious eyes<br />
Have watched the live-long night for thee,<br />
That from the threshold of the skies,<br />
Now looks o&rsquo;er a tempestuous sea;<br />
The ocean that so softly bright<br />
Hath mirror&rsquo;d oft the Queen of Night,<br />
In lustrous lines of liquid light,<br />
And, oh! hath looked so calm and fair,<br />
As if no storm could gather there.<br />
Like to those living lights that shine<br />
So pure and placid from the eyes,<br />
When at Religion&rsquo;s holy shrine<br />
The humble soul in rapture lies,<br />
And gloomy passions wake within,<br />
That lead away the heart to sin;<br />
Then all that looked so fair and bright,<br />
So pure in its own sportive glee,<br />
Becomes a torture and a blight,<br />
And wilder than the raging sea.</p>
<p class="poetry">The gale now slowly dies away,<br />
With the approach of dawning day,<br />
And every wave that chafes the shore,<br />
Salutes the strand with sullen roar,<br />
And on the beach in sadness flings<br />
All that to Hope was once so sweet,<br />
Like trophies which a warrior brings,<br />
And lays them at his country&rsquo;s feet.<br />
Records that blood and death had earned,<br />
When mercy from her shrine was spurned.<br />
Alas! when angry storms break forth,<br />
And wake the waters into wrath;<br />
Ah! then the treacherous heaving wave<br />
Rolls over many a wanderer&rsquo;s grave,<br />
And striving winds and foaming surge<br />
Sing many a mournful funeral dirge.</p>

In hallowed watches while she slept,<br />
Is pillowed on the sandy shore,<br />
Her lullaby the waters&rsquo; roar:<br />
And frowning skies in sorrow spread<br />
Their canopy around her head.</p>
<p class="poetry">And now beside the maiden kneels<br />
A messenger of fond relief,<br />
One who with sweet religion heals<br />
The wounded spirit&rsquo;s cankering grief;<br />
And raises from the chilly sand<br />
The form that cold and lifeless lay,<br />
Sustains it with a trembling hand,<br />
And wraps it in his mantle grey.<br />
And from that frontlet wipes away<br />
The wanton water&rsquo;s brackish spray.<br />
And now her wild and anxious gaze<br />
Is fixed upon his swarthy cheek,<br />
And faint and feebly she essays<br />
Her wonder and despair to speak;<br />
And he who looked so calm before,<br />
Is moved to tears of sorrow now,<br />
That as he bends the maiden o&rsquo;er,<br />
Those drops of pity damp her brow.<br />
He turns as though ashamed to own<br />
His heart has soft and yielding grown.<br />
And now is many an offer made<br />
Of home and hospitable aid,<br />
By those who throng around the maid,<br />
To them the monk his charge commends,<br />
With promises of bounteous pay,<br />

Who left the fair and beaten track<br />
Of sweet Religion&rsquo;s holy zeal,<br />
And to the cold world wandered back;<br />
Whose only oriflamme should be<br />
The sanguine cross of Calvary.<br />

Yes, he who taught that heavenly love<br />
Should all absorb the anxious mind,<br />
That hearts should look to hopes above,<br />
And leave the thoughtless world behind:<br />
Yes, he whose years though few had been,<br />
In much of deep devotion past,<br />
Who joy&rsquo;d the smiling summer scene,<br />
And braved the winter&rsquo;s bitter blast;<br />
Yes, he who told how dear and sweet<br />
Was holy influence to the mind,<br />
Who walked the world with weary feet,<br />
To succour helpless human kind;<br />
Yes, he forgot for beauty&rsquo;s smile,<br />
His oath to Heaven, his hopes above,<br />
He gave his heart to pleasures wile,<br />
And lost his soul for woman&rsquo;s love.<br />
Yes, he forgot the lowly mien,<br />
The holy mass, the rosary,<br />
And all that he had ever been,<br />
For hopeless love and misery.</p>
<p class="poetry">Alas! that grief should ever wear<br />
So pale a cheek with sorrow&rsquo;s tear,<br />
That anguish and remorse should trace<br />
Their furrowed lines on Beauty&rsquo;s face,<br />
And early troubles lead the way<br />
For dread disease and slow decay.<br />
There is a canker of the breast<br />
That pleasure cannot charm away,<br />
When the young heart becomes a prey<br />
To dread disquiet, and un-rest.<br />
Day after day&mdash;day after day,<br />
Along that smooth and sandy shore,<br />
Did Herbert with fair Edith stray,<br />
Oft listening to the angry roar<br />
Of the wild ocean&rsquo;s troubled sound,<br />
Till the fair earth had wandered round<br />
The presence of the glorious sun;<br />
And when the winter had begun<br />
To shackle every limpid river,<br />
And silence every gurgling rill,<br />
And in the woodland on the hill<br />
The aspen leaves had ceased to quiver,<br />
And every minstrel in the wood<br />
Was silent in its solitude,<br />
Those lovely birds that gaily chanted<br />
Their songs of gladness from the grove;<br />
Ah! oft had Edith&rsquo;s bosom panted<br />
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>With
silent and supreme delight,<br />
When they have woke the lovely night<br />
With their melodious songs of love.<br />
Ah! many and many a lovely eve,<br />
Beneath the Heaven&rsquo;s bespangled roof,<br />
Did her young heart delight to weave<br />
The future like a fairy woof:<br />
And with her Herbert by her side,<br />
In the sweet hush of eventide,<br />
When night-blown flowers of beauty rare<br />
With perfume filled the stilly air;<br />
Often in those delightful hours,<br />
When the young dreamy heart of youth<br />
Plucks many a wreath from Fancy&rsquo;s bowers,<br />
And knits them on the brow of truth.<br />
And once she said, with tearful eye,<br />
With quivering lip, yet tender tone,<br />
As if her weak and trembling heart<br />
Were half afraid its fears to own&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Herbert forgive, I know thou wilt,<br />
Or else my heart the wish would rue,<br />
Ah! if it bears the taint of guilt,<br />
In mercy, Heaven, absolve me too.<br />
When death with chilling hand shall sever<br />
The souls that nought but death could part,<br />
Herbert, a slow consuming fever<br />
Is burning at my brain and heart:<br />
I feel that death is calmly stealing<br />
Over my senses, day by day,<br />
Immortal longings and a feeling<br />
Of rapture charms my pulse away.<br />
Herbert, dear Herbert, my request,<br />
My last sad dying wish would be,<br />
That in the last embrace of death,<br />
My rest may then be near to thee;<br />
And by the willows that o&rsquo;ershade<br />
The streamlet on the woodland hill,<br />
Our dust may be in sadness laid,<br />
And, though in death, together still.&rdquo;<br />
Down Herbert&rsquo;s cheeks the drops of woe<br />
Coursed sad and slowly&mdash;whilst the maid<br />
Her last and earnest wishes prayed.<br />
It was a dread and bitter throe&mdash;<br />
Such as fond hearts, when doomed to sever,<br />
At once unheeded and for ever,<br />
Pure ardent souls alone could know.<br />
He clasped her to his aching heart&mdash;<br />
Her brow, alas! how pale and chill;<br />
An icy glaze is o&rsquo;er her eye,<br />
And yet her lips are quivering still.<br />

Nor yet my lone and humble lot,<br />
That made me what ye see me now.<br />
She was perchance an erring light,<br />
A beauteous wandering meteor flame,<br />
That on my waking vision came,<br />
To cross my pathway like a blight;<br />
Or else a Heavenly spirit sent<br />
From a diviner element,<br />
Who left some star-lit world that lies<br />
Far off in azure&rsquo;s seas than this,<br />
To teach my spirit what sweet bliss,<br />
Were in her home beyond the skies.<br />
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>But yet
she passed,&mdash;she drooped away,<br />
Like a fair rose untimely blighted,<br />
Like an Hymeneal altar lighted<br />
On a fond bridegroom&rsquo;s dying day.<br />
There was a flush upon her cheek,<br />
That in my soul a sadness wrought,<br />
A warning voice that used to speak,<br />
The lesson of her life&rsquo;s decay;<br />
There was a lustre in her eyes,<br />
Like a celestial glory caught,<br />
From some bright meteor of the skies.<br />
There was a music in her tone,<br />
Like the low wind of Autumn makes,<br />
Through the lone woods in sadness sighing,<br />
When the bright leaves and flowers are dying,<br />
As if it sighed for their sweet sakes.<br />
Although I know and feel she died,<br />
Her form and voice are with me now,<br />
These are the hands that from her brow<br />
Were wont so often to divide<br />
The tresses of her golden hair,<br />
When the night winds had wanton&rsquo;d there.<br />
But when we wandered through the glade,<br />
And heard the night bird on the bough,<br />
Or side by side together prayed,<br />
Is but a fading vision now.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CAISTER.</h3>
<p>Caister or Caistor, a pleasant village situated upon the
coast, about two miles and a half to the northward of Yarmouth,
possesses the remains of a Roman station, and the ruins of
Caister castle.&mdash;A lofty circular tower and a large portion
of the north and west walls belonging to the latter are very
prominent.&nbsp; This is supposed to be one of the oldest brick
mansions in England.&nbsp; It was erected by Sir John Fastolf,
who was born here, or at Yarmouth, in 1378.&nbsp; He entered
early in life a brilliant military career, and signalized himself
by many acts of bravery during a forty years&rsquo; campaign <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>under the
English Regency in France, and history records, in the course of
this period, he was made in the field of battle a Knight
Banneret, a Baron of France, Knight of the Garter, Marshal of the
Regent&rsquo;s Household, the King&rsquo;s Lieutenant in
Normandy, and progressively appointed to various public
offices.&nbsp; He subsequently returned to Caistor, and his
liberality, munificence, and acts of charity were not equalled in
the period in which he lived.&nbsp; He became a founder of
religious and other edifices, a generous patron of learning, an
encourager of piety, and a benefactor to the poor.</p>
<p>A quibble on the name of this truly great and eminent man has
been raised by some authors, who supposed him to be the Sir John
Falstaff, whom our immortal bard Shakspeare delineated in the
humorous but abandoned character as constantly lounging about the
court of Prince Henry (afterwards Henry the Vth. of
England).&mdash;The poetical Falstaff was nearly threescore years
of age at the battle of Shrewsbury, A.D. 1403, when the Norfolk
hero was not more than twenty-five.&nbsp; The former ended his
career soon after Prince Henry ascended the throne&mdash;the
latter survived Henry the Vth. thirty-seven years, and died at
Caistor in 1459.</p>
<h3>CROMER.</h3>
<p>Cromer, formerly a small market town, is situated nine miles
N.N.W. of North Walsham, and on the verge of the German
Ocean.&nbsp; At the Doomsday survey Cromer formed part of the
lordship and parish of Shipden, a considerable village, which,
with its church, dedicated to St. Peter, appears to have been
swallowed up by the sea about the time of Henry the 4th.&nbsp; A
patent to collect certain dues for the erection of a pier was
granted in the 14th of Richard II.&nbsp; At neap tides, in calm
weather, are still to be seen, about half a mile distant from the
shore, large masses of wall, which are supposed to have belonged
to the church alluded to.</p>
<p>Many large portions of land were washed away in 1611, previous
to which the inhabitants expended considerable sums of money and
ingenuity in a fruitless attempt to maintain a small
harbour.&nbsp; In the winter of 1799, the light-house cliffs,
projecting from the beach three hundred and twenty feet, made
several remarkably large shoots, one of which brought with it
half an acre of ground, and extended into the sea beyond low
water mark.&nbsp; On January 15th, 1825, another large mass of
earth was detached from the light-house hills, and fell with
great force on the beach, extending in breadth above three
hundred yards from the cliffs, covering an area of twelve acres,
and containing, it was supposed, not less than half a million of
cubic yards of earth.&nbsp; The fall of this enormous body was
sudden and unexpected.&nbsp; A large stream of water issued from
the bank <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>immediately after its fall, and discharged itself down
upon the beach with great noise and violence.&nbsp; Early in the
morning of August 19th, 1832, another large shoot of the cliffs
occurred near the light-house, which threatened the destruction
of that useful edifice.&nbsp; It was deemed expedient to erect
another on the hill, two hundred and fifty yards inland; but the
remains of the old one are still standing about three-quarters of
a mile east of the town, where it was built of brick in 1719.</p>
<p>These immense landslips were almost entirely owing to the
numerous fresh water springs abounding in this locality, but the
damage the town of Cromer experienced, and referred to in Chapter
III., was caused by the ocean, during a continuous gale of
wind.</p>
<p>According to tradition, Cromer church, dedicated to St. Peter
and St. Paul, is supposed to have been erected in the reign of
Henry 4th, soon after the village of Shipden disappeared.&nbsp;
It is a large and handsome edifice, built of flint and
free-stone, in the Gothic style, with a fine tower 154 feet in
height, and richly ornamented with sculpture.&nbsp; The west
entrance, the north porch, and the chancel have been long in
ruins, and very little of the latter now remains; and history
informs us, that many of its ornaments were destroyed by
Cromwell&rsquo;s soldiers, who converted it into barracks.</p>
<p>As a watering place Cromer richly deserves the celebrity it
has attained; and the encomiums conferred by those who have
visited it during the summer months, are certainly not
exaggerated.&nbsp; Nature indeed, appears to have bestowed her
favours with no sparing hand to render it a delightful retreat
for the invalid&mdash;or those who require a relaxation from the
noise and bustle of a city life&mdash;and for those who are
desirous to prosecute their studies with ease and comfort, almost
amounting to enchantment.&nbsp; The most fastidious could but be
pleased with the beauty of the surrounding scenery&mdash;with the
accommodation provided by enterprising individuals&mdash;with the
civility and courteous demeanour of its inhabitants, who from the
highest to the lowest grade, take every possible pains to deserve
lasting esteem and friendship.&nbsp; The fishermen too are
exceedingly well behaved, and their looks pourtray a contentment
approaching to happiness, that indicates the labour attending
their perilous vocation is rewarded.</p>
<p>The village of Shipden, with its church dedicated to St.
Peter, which lay between Cromer and the sea, has wholly
disappeared.</p>
<h3>ECCLES.</h3>
<p>Eccles by the Sea, nine miles east by south of North Walsham,
was a hamlet of the great lordship of Hasborough or Happisburgh,
from whence it is about two miles distant.&nbsp; It not only
appears fast <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>sinking into oblivion itself, but also holds a fearful
destiny over a large tract of valuable marsh land in the eastern
division of the county, by reason of the inlet it may sooner or
later afford to an irruption of the sea.</p>
<p>In the reign of Edward the Confessor it was held by Edric, a
Dane of noble extraction, afterwards by Ralph, Earl of Norfolk,
through whom it became forfeited to the Crown.&nbsp; William the
Conqueror bestowed it upon Roger Bigot, whence it passed
successively into the hands of William de Albini, ancestor of the
Earls of Arundale, William le Parker, and several other noblemen
of renown in the annals of chivalry.</p>
<p>Many curious privileges and customs the lords of the manor
derived in those days&mdash;for we find in 33rd of Edward the
1st, 1305, William le Parker was entituled to receive wreck of
sea, lagan, and resting geld, customs, and other profits upon the
sea and land, and of every crew of a ship or boat washing their
nets in the said village after Michaelmas to Martlemas, an
hundred herrings, and also a fee for goods, chattels, &amp;c.,
coming to land by sea, without the help of the said William or
his servant, or resting upon the land one day and one night; and
if the said William or his men, &amp;c., immediately after
imminent danger, or after shipwreck, shall do their endeavour to
save such things, then the said William shall have a third part
of all such things, or the value of them, unless of his good will
he will omit something, but must not be asked.&mdash;Among the
land customs was the bed gild, and at every wedding, noble or
ignoble, the lords of the manor had the privilege of consummating
the nuptials of the bride, or receiving a fee instead.&nbsp; This
indecorous system prevailed in some parts of Scotland not many
years since.</p>
<p>These arbitrary laws, enacted in the earlier period of
England&rsquo;s history, when ignorance prevailed, and barbarism
allowed the honoured and the wealthy to impose exactions cruel
and oppressive, on those beneath them, may possibly have in many
instances, from humanity, been omitted.&nbsp; At all events, as
knowledge advanced, we find that not only have those which
pressed so heavily upon the poor industrious fishermen been
cancelled, but that others have been reduced to an extent
compatible with the necessary protection to property exposed to
the pilferer, from lamentable accidents on the coast.&nbsp; And
it is highly gratifying to observe, that until recently no murmur
or complaint has been raised against the lords of the manor, and
this is confined to two or three districts, and arose from the
following circumstance:&mdash;From time immemorial, it appears,
persons have been allowed to take whatever sea-beach materials
they required for domestic or other purposes, without molestation
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>or the
exaction of any fee.&nbsp; But the increasing demand induced
individuals who were deputed by the lords of the manor to
officiate in their stead, to apply for permission to charge so
much per freight or load; which being granted, a pretty income
has been realized from the hundreds of loads of sand, stones,
&amp;c., removed annually.&mdash;A curious coincidence, however,
is connected with it.&nbsp; One of these deputy lords, a few
years since, observed that the removal of sea-beach materials,
within a given distance of the road or gangway to the beach,
afforded an inlet for the ocean to under mine and remove the foot
of the gangway to such an extent, that an expence was necessarily
incurred, from time to time, in repairing it, besides the loss of
land on either side of it.&nbsp; He therefore applied for
permission to fix up a board in the vicinity, on which was
printed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;By order of the
Magistrates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice is hereby given&mdash;Should any person or
persons take away or remove any sand near the gangway and foot of
the cliffs, he or they shall be prosecuted, and upon conviction,
shall suffer the extreme penalty of the law.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But strange to relate, no sooner did the deputy lord receive
permission to dispose of the sea-beach materials, than the board
was taken down, and individuals are permitted to take them away,
if not in the immediate vicinity of the gangway, at least at the
foot or base of the cliffs.</p>
<p>Every remaining vestige of Eccles denotes antiquity.&nbsp;
Ancient stone walls have been exposed within the last three years
by the action of the sea, removing lofty sand hills, and the
peasantry have picked up silver and copper coins of great
antiquity.&nbsp; But a still stronger evidence of a remote period
may be traced in the wells constructed with large unburned
bricks, formed in a mould wider at one end than at the other, to
adapt them to the true circumference of the well itself.&nbsp; It
is quite clear the wells had been filled up with earth, and
ceased to be used before the abandonment of the place, since near
to every one of them is a stone well, built with mortar, similar
to the churches, which possibly denotes the first step towards
civilization in this country.&nbsp; It formerly contained two
thousand acres of land, but so wasted by the incursion of the
German Ocean, that the inhabitants, in their petition for a
reduction of taxes, in the reign of James the 1st, complained
they had then only fourteen houses and three hundred acres of
land.&nbsp; The whole now comprises a few cottages, with the
church tower, and one hundred and fifty acres of land.&nbsp; The
church was dedicated to St. Mary.</p>
<p>History informs us, that the parish of Whimpnell, formerly
situated <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>between Hasborough and Eccles, has been entirely removed
by the sea.</p>
<h3>HASBOROUGH.</h3>
<p>Hasborough, denominated also Happisburgh, situated seven miles
south-east of North Walsham, is a considerable village,
containing a church dedicated to St. Mary.&nbsp; Its steeple,
110&frac12; feet in height, stands on an elevated point of land,
and is extremely useful to the mariner as a land-mark.&nbsp; In
former days a large wooden cross presented itself a considerable
height above and from the centre of the steeple, which rendered
it still more conspicuous, and prior to 1818 it became so
decayed, that it was blown down.&nbsp; The inhabitants erected
another in its stead, which, during a heavy tempest in 1822,
unfortunately served as a conductor for the electric fluid, which
demolished it, and also a large portion of the south-east
buttress; the latter fell upon and passed through the roof of the
church, on to the aile beneath.&nbsp; On this occasion the
electric fluid set fire to the church, and had not the promptest
measures been resorted to, it must have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Here also was erected, in 1791, two light-houses, the one a
hundred and the other eighty feet high.&nbsp; The upper part of
each terminates in a dome; immediately beneath is the lantern,
and on the outside a platform, surrounded with iron palisading,
whose verge consists of a flat piece of the same material.&nbsp;
Some years since, an unfortunate individual, subject to mental
aberration, while in an extremely excited state, walked on the
top or rim of the palisading, round one of the lights.&nbsp; This
feat he safely accomplished, and extraordinary to relate, it had
the desirable effect to render him calm and collected for several
years.</p>
<p>A lover of the picturesque would be amply repaid for the
trouble taken to reach the platform, which, as before observed,
describes a circle, the one half presenting, on a clear day, a
beautiful marine view, the other a splendid landscape.</p>
<p>In the former, the ocean, as far as the eye can reach,
exhibits a vast expanse of troubled water, imparting sound which
murmurs discontent.&nbsp; Its bosom too, after northerly and
north-easterly winds, is frequently bedecked with vessels bound
to some distant port, and from their being so numerous, so
variable in size and form, and gliding so near the shore, they
produce a beautiful panorama, not surpassed on any other part of
the coast.</p>
<p>From the latter is seen in the distance, the spire of Norwich
Cathedral, Cromer and Winterton light-houses.&nbsp; The
intermediate space presenting pretty scenery of hill and dale,
with here and there a mansion surrounded with plantations.&nbsp;
The spires of the village <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>churches too are numerous and
conspicuous, and the ruins of antiquated buildings, especially
the Priory of Broomholme, at Bacton, is a picture in itself
inviting our thoughts to roam to by-gone times.&mdash;The lands
divided with fences, neat and trim, and the fields, exhibit,
during the summer months, the various colours of the ripening
corn.&nbsp; Farm-houses located at uncertain distances, and the
humble cottages of the industrious poor, present at once a
<i>coup-d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> of the blessings conferred on
industry and enterprize.</p>
<p>To the Geologist and the Antiquarian a fine field for
research, and a glorious treat, is afforded them.&nbsp; Within a
short distance to the northward are lofty cliffs, containing in
the different strata, relics of animals; some similar to those in
the present day; others that never existed in the memory of the
oldest historian; and those which now exist only in the torrid
zone.&nbsp; The shells of fish that only inhabit rivers whose
waters have departed to other channels, whose beds have been
covered up probably for ages, while the trunks of trees, and
stumps, with their strong roots extended, are frequently exposed
after strong gales of wind.</p>
<p>To the southward is old Eccles steeple, ready to be snatched
into the briny ocean; at its foot, towards the sea, is the
remaining portion of the sacred edifice, with other foundations,
indicating where once had existed the humming noise of human
beings, exercising their vocation for individual and collective
benefit.&nbsp; On either side of the old steeple are capacious
banks, where the marram grows spontaneously, whose long tufts
conceal the wily rabbit and the timid hare.&nbsp; Here the weary
may rest; the contemplative picture to himself scenes that are
past, present, and to come.&nbsp; Here pic-nic parties, merry
meetings, the young and old, may partake of a delightful
recreation, which a wonderful yet beautiful world presents;
containing the fountain from whence all Philosophy springs and
ends, and embracing the evidence of an Infinite Being, in the
grandeur and magnificence of Creation.</p>
<h3>HORSEY.</h3>
<p>Horsey next the Sea must have been formerly one of the most
uninviting hamlets ever beheld.&nbsp; It lies between Waxham and
Winterton, and is eleven miles north by west of Yarmouth.&nbsp;
Its lonely situation, its containing a large lake, called Horsey
mere, and intersected with ditches of stagnant water, cannot
render it even now prepossessing.&nbsp; And were it not for its
complete exposure to wind from every quarter, it probably would
be very unhealthy.&mdash;Such a singular aspect did it assume
some years since, that an early historian, alluding to Horsey,
recommended it to the notice of government, as being peculiarly
adapted for prisoners of war, especially <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>the French;
observing they could be retained there readily, as there was only
one road to it; and its growing roots in abundance, besides an
innumerable quantity of frogs, the expense for maintaining them
would be inconsiderable.</p>
<p>The present proprietor&rsquo;s highly respected ancestor,
about fifty years since, purchased the manor, when it was of
little value, being generally flooded, and having expended a
considerable sum of money in draining the marshes, repairing the
sea-bank, and making a road to Somerton, an adjoining village
leading to Yarmouth, has rendered it one of the most fertile
estates in the county.</p>
<p>On the sea-bank within the bounds of this parish is Little
Waxham, a manor of 160 acres; but the village, and its church
dedicated to St. Margaret, were swept away by the ocean many
years ago.</p>
<h3>KESWIC.</h3>
<p>Keswic or Casewic, situated to the east of Bacton, appears to
have been part of the manor, and extended to this place and
Broomholme.&nbsp; In 1382, the church, dedicated to St. Clement,
was standing, and when it became deserted cannot be
determined.</p>
<p>Extensive ruins remained for several years, which were taken
down on the day of the coronation of George the Third and Queen
Charlotte, with the exception of a small portion, now forming
walls to two or three cottages.</p>
<p>A considerable part of the village is now in the sea from the
falling of the cliffs.</p>
<h3>MUNDESLEY.</h3>
<p>Mundesley is a pleasant village, situated about five miles
north by east of North Walsham, and has considerably improved
during the last few years, but, similarly to Bacton, to which it
is annexed, is continually wasting by the sea.&nbsp; A villa
erected by F. Wheatley, Esq., commands a beautiful marine view,
but to preserve it from the rapacity of the ocean, upwards of
three thousand pounds have been expended.</p>
<h3>PALLING.</h3>
<p>Palling next the Sea lies between Eccles and Waxham, and is
about twenty miles north-east of Norwich.&nbsp; It is celebrated
in ancient records as being the residence of Godwin, Earl of
Kent, in the reign of Edward the Confessor.&nbsp; William the
Conqueror afterwards seized on it, and at the grand survey,
Godric was bailiff or steward of it for that king.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Within
the last few months, the sea has removed the beach at low water
mark, and exposed the strata beneath its surface.&nbsp; In it are
the remains of the trunks and roots of trees; the former broken
off from three to four feet above the strata, while around lie
the remaining portions consisting of the branches, leaves,
&amp;c., but very much compressed.&nbsp; The bark of the beech is
very distinct, but the oak, and especially the red fir, are in
the best state of preservation.&nbsp; The wood of the latter has
evidently undergone considerable chemical change, for the
ligneous or fibrous part is very perfect, but its resinous
properties are absent, consequently the wood when dried, is much
lighter, and smells strongly of sulphur.&nbsp; It is impossible
to ascertain how long the trees have been covered up, but
probably some centuries.</p>
<h3>TRIMINGHAM.</h3>
<p>Trimingham is situated on the tall cliffs between Mundesley
and Cromer, and five miles north by east of North Walsham.&nbsp;
Like the former, it has been subject to the encroachments of the
ocean for a series of years, and is now reduced to a small
village.&nbsp; The church stands on the highest point of the
cliffs; and history relates that its ancient priests professed to
have the head of St. John the Baptist.&nbsp; Pilgrims came a long
distance with great offerings, and thus became the dupes of
superstition and deceit.</p>
<h3>WAXHAM.</h3>
<p>Waxham lies on the coast between Palling and Horsey, and is
about fourteen miles north-west of Yarmouth.&nbsp; This parish
was formerly much more extensive, and although it has not been
encroached upon for some years, yet the sand hills appear
evidently inclined to recede.</p>
<p>The church, dedicated to St. John, exhibits considerable
dilapidation, the chancel end being quite in ruins.&nbsp; In the
church-yard lies interred the remains of the unfortunate mate of
the Hunter cutter.</p>
<h3>WELLS.</h3>
<p>Wells next the sea is situated five miles north by west of
Walsingham, and 32 miles north-west of Norwich.&nbsp; It
possesses a tolerably good harbour and several neat buildings,
but its streets are very irregular.&nbsp; The church, dedicated
to St. Nicholas, is a neat edifice, with a square tower.&nbsp; On
July 15th, 1817, a gale of wind from the north produced so high a
tide, that the marshes near Wells became inundated.</p>
<h3><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>WINTERTON.</h3>
<p>Winterton is an ancient village, annexed to Horsey on the
south, and within eight miles north by west of Yarmouth.&nbsp; It
is sheltered on the north-east by a bold promontory called
Winterton-Ness, and well known to the mariner as the most fatal
headland between Scotland and London.&nbsp; The church, dedicated
to the Holy Trinity and All Saints, possesses a fine tower, 118
feet in height, which commands an extensive view of the
ocean.</p>
<p>On the 27th of December, 1665, a tremendous high tide caused
such alarming breaches in the sand hills at Winterton, Horsey,
and Waxham, as to threaten destruction to all the valuable marsh
land from thence to Yarmouth, Beccles, &amp;c.</p>
<h3>YARMOUTH,</h3>
<p>Frequently termed Great Yarmouth, is the principal sea-port
town in Norfolk, and 123 miles distant N.E. of London.&nbsp; It
stands on the east bank of the river Yare (from whence it takes
its name), at its confluence with the Bure, about two miles from
the mouth of the haven, which is very extensive and
commodious.&mdash;From the appearance of the country, and an
ancient chart, supposed to have been drawn about A.D. 1000, it is
evident that a broad and extensive estuary divided this part of
the eastern coast, not only in the time of its most ancient
inhabitants, but for a long period after the Saxon Conquest,
extending its waters westward to the city of Norwich, northward
to Caistor, Reedham, Herringby, and Strumpshaw, and southward to
Gorleston, Burgh, Bungay, Harleston, and Haddiscoe.&nbsp; This
large arm of the ocean forming the grand receptacle of all the
eastern waters of Norfolk (as it still continues under the
circumscribed form of the Yare), began to disappear after the
fifth century, when the sand collecting at its entrance, was, by
the action of the waters, gradually formed into an island, which
ultimately extended itself to the main land, and became the
peninsula on which Yarmouth is founded.&nbsp; Several successive
disappointments, and an immense outlay of capital in endeavouring
to erect substantial havens for the guidance of the river waters
into the sea, had been experienced, and at length finally
accomplished by the erection of those beautiful piers and noble
jetty.&nbsp; In 1528 the work was commenced, and on the 2nd day
of March, 1559, men, women, and children, to the number of one
thousand, were employed, and succeeded, in the short space of two
days, in causing the water to issue forth into the sea, leaving a
depth of ten feet at ebb tide.&nbsp; In <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>1567, the
water forced a passage down the old channel, towards the village
of Corton.&nbsp; After this disaster, a celebrated Dutch engineer
was employed, who commenced his operations by driving and hedging
down large stakes and piles, to make a firm substantial
foundation; this was first done on the north and afterwards on
the south side of the entrance, for the purpose of forcing the
ebbing of the tide to run out by a north-east channel.&nbsp; The
next step was the erecting of piers for preventing the haven from
overflowing, and preserving, at all times of the tide, a
sufficient depth of water for ships to float at their
moorings.&nbsp; The jurisdiction of the haven includes that part
of the sea called Yarmouth roads, extending northward to Scratby,
and southward to Corton, in Suffolk.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Inundations</span>, <span
class="smcap">Shipwrecks</span>, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>In 1287, St. Nicholas&rsquo; Church was completely inundated
by the sea, during a tremendous flood, that did incredible damage
to the town, the greater part of which was under water.</p>
<p>In 1554, fifty sail of vessels was lost in one day and night,
and the crews perished.</p>
<p>In 1692, a fleet of two hundred sail of colliers, having left
the roads with a fair wind, were suddenly assailed by a
tremendous gale from the north-east.&nbsp; After they had passed
Winterton-ness, some of them tacked and arrived back safe in the
roads; the remainder pushed out to sea, but were unable, through
its violence, to clear the Ness to the southward.&nbsp; The night
was exceedingly dark, and missing the lights, few could find
their way; some rode out at a distance; but the rest, amounting
to one hundred and forty sail, were driven ashore, completely
wrecked, and scarcely any of the crews saved.&nbsp; At the same
unfortunate juncture, a number of coasting vessels, laden with
grain, bound to Holland, from Lynn and Wells, having just left
the roads, experienced the same disaster; so that in the whole
more than two hundred vessels and one thousand people were lost
in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>If vessels leaving Flamborough Head, proceed southward, and
meet with a heavy gale from any point between north-east and
south-east; or if leaving the Yarmouth roads, proceeding to the
northward, they are retarded by the wind blowing hard from the
north-east, so that they cannot weather Winterton-ness, they
become embayed, and the only chance for safety is to run for the
Lynn Deeps, in attempting which they are in danger of foundering
on the rocks near Cromer, or stranding on the flat shores between
Cromer and Wells.</p>
<p>In 1790, seventy sail of ships met with a similar fate, and
also their crews.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>In
1791, a raging tide inundated the denes and the meadows to such a
depth, that boats rowed on Southtown turnpike.</p>
<p>In 1805, a tremendous storm at sea occurred, accompanied by a
raging tide, which nearly destroyed the old jetty.</p>
<p>In 1825, a destructive tide ensued, which did much damage to
the town.&nbsp; The water flowed nearly to the doors of some of
the houses on the quays.&nbsp; The Southtown road was completely
overflowed and rendered impassable, the lower apartments in
several houses on the west side were under water, and much corn,
grain, and other merchandize in the store-houses spoiled.</p>
<p>To do ample justice to the highly interesting records
associated with this celebrated sea-port town, would form a
volume in itself, and the ingenuity and embellishments displayed
by its inhabitants, to be properly appreciated ought to be
visited, to form a lasting impression of their industry.&nbsp;
Situated on a narrow strip of land, less than a mile in breadth,
and stretching five miles from north to south, it cannot boast of
any pretty inland scenery, as the country is extremely flat, but
it possesses resources interesting and inviting to the
stranger.</p>
<p>Its harbour is excellently situated for affording shelter for
vessels unable to contend against contrary winds.&nbsp; Its
extensive traffic in coal and corn, and above all the celebrity
it has attained for its herring and mackerel fisheries, must ever
render it a place of the greatest importance.&nbsp; As a
watering-place its merits must not be forgotten.&nbsp; Splendid
edifices and admirable accommodation have been provided near the
sea-shore, enabling its visitors to partake of &ldquo;delightful
breezes to their hearts&rsquo; content,&rdquo; or to mingle with
the gaieties of a city life.&nbsp; As a naval station during the
late war, it proved highly advantageous; and in accordance with
that circumstance, a beautiful Monumental Pillar was erected on
the south Denes, about a mile from the town, to the memory of the
gallant Nelson.&nbsp; It is of Grecian Doric order, elegantly
fluted, and one hundred and forty-four feet in height, ascended
by an easy flight of steps.&nbsp; Upon the plinth are the names
of the four ships, &ldquo;Vanguard, Captain, Elephant, and
Victory,&rdquo; on board which the heroic Admiral&rsquo;s flag
was so valorously displayed; and on the coping of the terrace are
inscribed the names of the four principal
battles&mdash;&ldquo;Aboukir, St. Vincent, Copenhagen, and
Trafalgar.&rdquo;&nbsp; On each of the four sides of the pedestal
is a flight of steps leading to the terrace, which affords a
promenade round the shaft.&nbsp; The roof is supported by
Caryatides, surrounded by a ball, and a figure of Britannia,
admirably cast, holding in her hand a trident and a laurel
wreath.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>On
the west side is a very elegant Latin inscription, from the pen
of a Norfolk Gentleman, of which the following is a
translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">HORATIO LORD NELSON,<br
/>
Whom, as her first and proudest champion in naval fights,<br />
Britain honoured, while living, with her favour,<br />
and, when lost, with her tears;<br />
Of whom, signalized by his triumphs in all lands,<br />
the whole earth<br />
stood in awe on account of the tempered firmness of his<br />
counsels, and the undaunted ardour of his courage;<br />
This great man<br />
NORFOLK<br />
Boasts her own, not only as born there of a respectable
family,<br />
And as there having received his early education,<br />
But her own also in talents, manners, and mind,<br />
The glory of so great a name though sure long to<br />
Outlive all monuments of brass and stone,<br />
His fellow-countrymen of Norfolk have resolved to commemorate<br
/>
By this column, erected by their joint contributions.<br />
He was born in the year 1758;<br />
Entered on his Profession in 1771;<br />
And was concerned in nearly 150 Naval Engagements with the
enemy.<br />
Being Conqueror, among various other occasions,<br />
At Aboukir, August, 1798;<br />
At Copenhagen, April, 1801;<br />
And at Trafalgar, October, 1805:<br />
Which last Victory, the crown of so many glorious
achievements,<br />
He consecrated by a death, equally mournful to his country,<br />
And honourable to himself.</p>

Norfolk, published in 1842.&nbsp; The indefatigable and learned
Author being about to publish a work upon the Geology of Norfolk
generally, with an account of the Fossils, Bones, &amp;c.,

do, and the seed being threshed, might be sown in any locality

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
